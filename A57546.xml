            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter ſome more than ordinary, buſineſs, and fluctuating thoughts (occaſioned by my Father's Death), I have found ſo much leiſure as to preſent to your View this following Treatiſe, which hath been ſo long expected and deſired: And the rather,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe that thoſe who have the World coming in upon them, and are in danger of being Rich, may learn to be Rich in good Works, ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That thoſe who are of a mean Eſtate, being above the Foot of Scorn, and below the Eye of Envy, may contentedly ſubmit themſelves to be dyeted by the Almighty, who ſees what a Proneneſs there is in us to ſurfet upon Superfluities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the Poor may not emulate the Rich, nor murmur at God's Tranſactions, knowing that Wealth is no diſcriminating Sign, or infallible Token, of God's Favour or our Goodneſs. All which are amply demonſtrated and eagerly preſſed in this Parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Diſcourſe of <hi>The Rich Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:63725:4"/>
            <p>It is very certain, that all the Faculties of the Soul are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorated, weakned, and decayed, ſince the Apoſtacy of the old Protoplaſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and that, amongſt them all, the Memorative doth firſt <hi>Seneſcere:</hi> Therefore I cannot imagine it altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to ſtir you up by way of Remembrance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. moſt of our Auditors being like unto Sievs, which in the Water are full, but out of it, empty; ſo in the Church our Ears are full of Doctrine, but it is ſuddenly ſcatttered in the Church-Yard: <hi>Ne apicem tenemus,</hi> we carry little or nothing home.</p>
            <p>It is a Philoſophical Queſtion, Whether of the Senſes, the Ear or the Eye, be the better in it ſelf, becauſe that Grace is conveyed into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Soul by Hearing; yet certainly, according to Nature, the Eye is moſt excellent, both for celerity and perſpicacity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is <hi>Senſus efficaciſſimus,</hi> the quickeſt of Apprehenſion, exerciſing it ſelf <hi>intromittendo,</hi> by bringing the Object home (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>), and ſo carryes it to the heart with a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Impreſſion. No Senſe doth ſo firmly imprint forms in the Imagination; and what it ſees one day intentively, it ſees many dayes after.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is <hi>Senſus certiſſimus,</hi> the moſt certain of all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Vidi,</hi> I ſaw it, is an evident Teſtimony; and, Seeing uſually is Believing: <hi>Homines ſemper amplius oculis quàm auribus credunt,</hi> Men alwayes will give more Credence to what they ſee than to what they hear.</p>
            <p>In a word, No Senſe hath ſuch variety of Objects, and continuall Buſineſs, as the Eye: none ſo often put in Action; none ſo quick of Motion; none ſo ſerviceable to Reaſon, and commodious, if it be well guided.</p>
            <p>All which conſidered, I could do no leſs than ſet this Glaſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you (which hath formerly been promiſed to you) which is free from all manner of Flattery and Adulation; and which (being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and ſeriouſly peruſed) will make you <hi>Vobis notos,</hi> known unto your ſelvs.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, it is not for me (being ſo nearly related) to extoll the Author's worth; and indeed were I aſcertained of a <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Two Brethren were at Variance about their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Lands:<note place="margin">The Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

He, who thought himſelf wronged, (but whether he were or no, is very queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable) applies himſelf unto our Saviour, whom he conceived to be a wiſe and underſtanding man, intreating him to compoſe and take up that difference which was betwixt them, that an equal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being made, Law-Suits might be ſtayed, and expence of mony
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63725:14"/>ſpared, which otherwayes in all likelihood could not be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

            <p>But his mind at this time ſhould have been taken up with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters. Chriſt was diſcourſing on matters of a higher nature; and was it fit that he who came to hear the Word preached, ſhould have his heart run after worldly things? and poſſeſſed with carnall thoughts? Much more unfitting was it, and unbeſeeming him, to take the Liberty to interrupt our Saviour, whileſt he was Preaching to the People, with ſo bold and ſawcy a Requeſt as this, <hi>Master, Speak to my Brother that he divide the Inheritance with me.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63725:14"/>And this he illuſtrates by this (Parabolical Narration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was a very Rich man, the richeſt in the Country; for the whole Country was his, and that Country did bear and bring forth unto him a very great Crop of Corn, inſomuch that this Rich man did take great care where to beſtow it; he enters into a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with himſelf, what to do in that Caſe, and thus determines, To pull down his old Barns, and build others far more large and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in them he will beſtow his Goods for their ſecurity; which being done, he ſits down and ſings a Lullaby to his own Soul, (as if he were) ſufficiently provided for many years after. But the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue was, that the ſame very Night wherein he did thus ſolace him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Soul was taken from him, and he ſuddenly ſnatcht away from the Fruition of all thoſe worldly things, and they beſtowed on thoſe that would give him ſmall thanks for them. Lo, even ſuch a Fool as this Rich man was, and ſo ſure of the revenging hand of God, is that man, whoſoever he be, that ſets his heart upon earthly Riches, having no care of procuring true Grace, which only is able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his Soul, and make him happy. Now, that we may not loſe our ſelvs for want of Method, let us come to the Parts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Narration follows, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, —22. <hi>The Ground of a certain Rich man,</hi> &amp;c. Where we have the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>In the propounding Parts we have the Perſon ſpoken of, and the Relation that is made of him.</p>
            <p>The Perſon is ſet forth, 1. By his Titles, Common, <hi>A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain man;</hi> proper, <hi>A Rich man.</hi> 2. By his Poſſeſſions, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eſtate, he <hi>had Ground which brought forth plentifully.</hi> And there we have, Firſt the Intereſt or Propriety that he had, The Land
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63725:15"/>was His. 2. The Fertility of the Soil, <hi>It brought forth Fruit plentifully.</hi> He was a landed Man, and had a great Crop, a whole Region of Corn, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>That which is related of him, follows <hi>Ver.</hi> 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it reſpects his Life, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17,—20. and Death, <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. In the former we have his Comick, in the latter his Tragick parr.</p>
            <p>In his Life-time we find him, Firſt, caſting up of his Eſtate, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>And he thought within himſelf, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of Himſelf and Goods, <hi>And I will ſay unto my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>In the former we have him; Firſt, Conſulting, <hi>He thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. In which Conſultation is made known unto us, his Thoughts and Cogitations which were very ſecret; for, <hi>He thought within himſelf,</hi> and was much perplexed, What ſhall I do? And then the Ground or Reaſon of that Anxiety of Spirit, <hi>Becauſe I have no room where to beſtow my fruits;</hi> intimating unto us both his Indigence, in that he wanted Room; and his Abundance, for his Crop was ſo great that he knew not where to lay it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have him reſolving and determining of the Courſe which he would take, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. <hi>And he ſaid, This will I do,</hi> &amp;c. This his Determination is generally notified, <hi>This I will do.</hi> And more particularly ſpecified, <hi>I will pull down my Barns,</hi> &amp;c. expreſſing his Method, which was firſt to undo and then to do, he would pull down and then build bigger. And then his Meaning, <hi>There will I beſtow all my Fruits and my Goods,</hi> diſcovering thereby much Confidence in the Creature, he promiſeth all to the Barns; and Pride in himſelf, which appears by the manner of his ſpeaking, <hi>All my Fruits and my Goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having <hi>caſt up his Eſtate,</hi> he proceeds to <hi>diſpoſe of his Goods</hi> by <hi>Will-Paroll; And I will ſay to my Soul; Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 19. <hi>I will ſay,</hi> there is the <hi>Preface; Soul,</hi> there is the <hi>Solace;</hi> ſo that this Will is <hi>Prefaced</hi> with a <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>His <hi>Will</hi> is <hi>diſapproved; This Night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> Where we have,</p>

But the Doctrine of Salvation is taught after one ſort, even by the Preaching of the Goſpel, which is the Power of Salvation to every one that believeth; which one manner of ſpeaking far ſurpaſſeth all thoſe manners of ſpeaking, whereby God ſpake to them, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more powerfully, and pierceth into the heart of Man more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than any other manner of Perſwaſion, yea though one ſhould riſe from the dead and ſpeak to us.</p>
            <p>Then he ſpake only to the Fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and their Poſterity; to ſome few, and but one Nation. He ſhewed his word unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> his Statutes and his Judgments unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> He hath not dealt ſo with any Nation, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. and as for his Judgments, they have not known them. But now in theſe laſt dayes, God by his Son hath ſpoken to all inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, to Jew and Gentile, to Male and Female, to bond and free, all being one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. and through Faith hath one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance unto the Throne of Grace. So that, as one ſpeaketh upon that Text, We need not ſay, Now O Lord, remember <hi>David</hi> and the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> but, O Lord, remember me, and the Covenant which thou haſt made with my Father's Houſe: For, unto all, both thoſe that are nigh, and thoſe that are far off, there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63725:17"/>is but one Covenant in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13, 17.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Then God ſpake to the Fathers by the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; that is, the continual Succeſſion of the Prophets in all Ages, not by one alone but by all; from the beginning God uſed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Patriarchs to inſtruct their Families, but that did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy him. By the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> he inſtructed his People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; yet that did not content him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He uſed the Miniſtry of Prieſts and Prophets, yea, of one greater than a Prophet, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, to teach and inſtruct his Church; yet he reſted not therewith ſatisfied: But laſt of all, he ſent his Son, that eternall Word which is God, whom he hath made Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the World. Rare and ſingular men were thoſe by whom God inſtructed and taught his Church in elder times; yet not worthy ſo be named with Chriſt, by whom he ſpeaketh unto us: They were men, Chriſt is God and Man; they had excellent Gifts of Wiſdom and Knowledge, yet all their Wiſdom and Knowledge was but borrowed; Chriſt was wiſe of himſelf, the Fountain of all Wiſdom and Knowledg, and of his fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace: They were mortal, and ſaw Corruption; nor was any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, when he was taken away by Death, able to give Grace to others that ſhould come after, or of his fulneſs to make other learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Myſteries of Salvation; but Chriſt abideth for ever, he ſtill liveth to appoint us Teachers, and of his fulneſs he giveth all others their continual encreaſe of Grace: By all which you ſee how wonderfully God hath honoured us above thoſe who lived in the time of the Law: Many Prophets and Kings have deſired to ſee thoſe things which we ſee, and have not ſeen them; and to hear thoſe things which we hear, and have not heard them, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.24. The Goſpel is a Myſtery, and a great Myſtery too, which was hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſecret Cloſet of God's own Breaſt; not poſſible to enter into the heart of Man, till Chriſt brought it out of the Boſom of his Father and diſcovered it unto Man-kind. Nor could Men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do that: he only had Power to open the Book, who was both God and Man in Union; by vertue of which Union thoſe divine Truths and heavenly Myſteries which were,<note place="margin">Joh. 1 18.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63725:17"/>by Chriſt, becauſe in him alone is the Divine and Humane Nature united.</p>
            <p>Now the greater Love that God hath ſhewed us,<note place="margin">Mat. 21.33, 41.</note> the ſoarer Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in caſe of Contempt and Diſobedience. See then that you deſpiſe not him that ſpeaks from Heaven, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. For if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape if we turn from him that ſpeaks from Heaven to us. He that deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> Law dyed without Mercy, under two or three Witneſſes (that is, being Legally convicted), <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. now of how much ſoarer Puniſhment ſhall he be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who deſpiſeth the Goſpel whereof the Son of God is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?

               </gap>, Look to it therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, that you do it not; for it is as much as your Souls are worth.</p>
            <p>And yet how little is God's Speaking to us by this his Son regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? Many of the Phariſees knew him to be the Son of God; This is the Heir (ſay they), come let us kill him <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.38. They were not altogether ignorant that he was the Lord of Life whom they ſlew. Were Chriſt now living upon the Earth, Do you not think that there are ſome ſo maliciouſly bent againſt the Goſpel and the ſincere Preaching of it, as that they could find in their hearts to kill Chriſt himſelf? You (it may be) will ſay, as they did who heard Chriſt propounding that Parable unto them, and fore-telling them of that Cruelty which they would ſhew in putting him to Death, <hi>God forbid</hi> Luke 20.16. We cannot perſwade men that their hearts are half ſo bad, or their wayes ſo dangerous, as Preachers would make them; but when men will perſecute the Miniſters of the Goſpel for their Fidelity in diſpenſing of the Word, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Servants, they will never ſtick to murder the Maſter; he that heareth you heareth me, ſaith Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.40</note> and he that deſpiſeth you deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So they who perſecute them, impriſon them, put them to death, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, If God have ſo honoured us that live in the time of the Goſpel, above them in the time of the Law; Should it not be our care to honour him, love him, fear him, and obey him, above thoſe who lived in thoſe dayes? He ſpake to them in old time, in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63725:18"/>eldeſt Age of the World, he ſpeaks to us in a new time, when all things are made new by Chriſt. <hi>It was ſaid to them old, but I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 5.21, 27.

            <p>Nor are we only addicted to it, but generally infected with it: Covetouſneſs (ſaith one) is an Epidemical Diſeaſe, an univerſal Plague, from which no ſort is free: And, Saith not the Scripture the ſame alſo? <hi>From the leaſt of them even unto the greateſt of them, every one is given to Covetouſneſs.</hi> Jer. 6.13.

            <p>And yet though it be in all, yet it is not in the like manner, nor in the like degree in all. In the wicked Worldling it rules and reigns, he is a Servant and Slave to it; In ſome of the wicked it is the chief Lord and Soveraign, bearing Rule and commanding for it ſelf; many other Vices are in them, but that is the Capital Vice, other Vices are ſubſervient to it; his Pride and his unjuſt Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all are but Servants to this his Covetouſneſs. Thus this Rich Fool the Parable ſpeaks of, prided himſelf in his great Eſtate, and made it his Glory; His Pride iſſued from the great Crop that he had, and this doth apparantly denominate a man to be a Worldling.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is ſubſervient, being under the Command and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſome other Luſt, like an under-Officer; and is (as one terms it) the Purveyor or Taker for Ambition, Prodigality, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without the Service of which their Luſts could not be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But whether it be in a wicked man whole Maſter or Quarter-Maſter, it rules in him and brings him into Bondage: Nor is there a wicked man under Heaven, but either in Predominancy or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency he is a Slave to the World; and albeit there may be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace in him to keep him from exorbitancy, yet Covetouſneſs retains it's own Nature ſtill, as a Lyon doth the Nature of a Lyon although he be chained.</p>
            <p>In a godly Chriſtian, albeit there be a natural propenſity remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him towards worldly and earthly things, yet the Love of the World is not ſuch as that it doth bear ſway in his heart, (albeit it may diſcover it ſelf in ſome Acts more or leſs towards predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.)

Worldlineſſe and Covetouſneſs is a ſly and ſubtile Sin, hardly diſcerned by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, neither in himſelf nor others: All Vices can dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs in the habit of Vertue; Pride ſhall be Handſomneſs; Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, Good-Fellowſhip; Riotouſneſs, Liberality; and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs comes not behind any of them all, in her Diſguiſes: That ſhall be Frugality and Good-Husbandry in providing for Poſterity; it hath more Pleas than any other Sin in the World hath, more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours put upon it, more Cloaks to cover it.

This we lay down for a divine Aphoriſm (ſaith one), that Scripture is of it ſelf abundantly ſufficient for us; but we are not ſufficient for it, without the help of Arts and humane Learning: We are not able to interpret the Text without Grammar, nor to divide without Logick, nor profitably preſs and apply it without the help of Rhetorick: Sundry Paſſages in Scripture depend upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of Words and Idioms, which without the help of humane Learning cannot be opened: and for want of Learning much Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>Such ſacred Parables and Similitudes as we find in Scripture are not only Ornaments, but ſpecial Arguments of a Diſcourſe, if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed; for they may not be preſſed beyond the Scope of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt in uſing and applying them; nor may any Point of Faith be gathered from them, it not being backed with ſome plainer Proof from other Scripture; yet may a Point of Doctrine be as ſubſtantially confirmed, and Errour as ſtrongly reproved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by thoſe Scriptures which are ſet down in Similitudes and borrowed Speeches, as by any other Scripture; ſo far forth as the Scope reacheth.</p>

But this is not God's way; It was his Command to his Prophet ſo to declare his mind unto the People, and after ſuch a

And thus the Levites in the dayes of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did ſo read the Law unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as that they cauſed the People to underſtand it, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.7.

To believe a thing further than we know it, is impoſſible; to love it, is Leightneſs; to hate it, is Injuſtice (foraſmuch as it may deſerve the contrary, for ought that we know); therefore, as the Apoſtle concludes in that Chapter, 1 Cor. 14.19. <hi>Five words ſpoken to the Underſtanding, do more good in the Church of God than ten thouſand ſpoken in a ſtrange Tongue, ſuch as you underſtand not without an Interpreter;</hi> or in that Language

            <p>There are others amongſt us in the other Extream, who bring to the hearing of the Word a rude Ruſtical Ear; no Preaching ſhall be liked by them, wherein there is any thing ſmelling of the Lamp; no Preacher approved that makes any Shew of Wit and Art in any of his Labours, thinking it impoſſible for the Miſtreſs and the Hand-maid to agree together: All muſt come without Study or Meditation. A Sermon premeditated, is, in their Judgments, to tye the Holy Ghoſt unto an Ink-horn, and to confine it within the bounds of a ſandy Hour-glaſs; Let them hear a Sermon of God's own making, and not of Man's compoſing; Turn the Cock and let it run: Such as ſo preach (they ſay) preach in the Evidence of the Spirit and Demonſtration of Power.

            <p>And others there are who are rich in Mediocrity, living in a golden mean, between plenty and penury, being neither eminently rich, nor miſerably poor (the eſtate that <hi>Augur</hi> deſired of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8, 9.)

            <p>We read in the Goſpel of ſome Labourers, who having received their full pay for their day's Work, yet murmured againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Houſe; for that he had given unto ſome who laboured but one hour in his Vineyard, as he had given unto them, who had born the burthen and heat of the day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.11.

               </gap>udg to ſee their Neighbours thrive and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Wealth, when they themſelvs, who take more pains, riſing up early; and going to Bed late, eating the Bread of Sorrow, and drinking the Wine of Care; yet go ſlowly on, and can hardly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and maintain themſelves and Families by their Labours. But for the quieting of the Spirits of theſe, and ſuppreſſing of all ſuch murmuring and repining thoughts, let theſe things be pondered on.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is the wiſe God that doth thus order things: They fall not out by Fortune and Chance, as ſome imagine, who tell us, that ſuch or ſuch a one was born to a good Fortune, and that a good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath befell him; but it is by the Will and Providence of God that theſe things thus fall out. We are all like Counters upon a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he makes uſe of in caſting up his Accounts, and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Ends. If one man be in the place of Hundreds, yea, Thouſands; and another in the place of Pounds, yea, Pence;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4 7.</note> God had the principal hand in laying of us there: And it muſt be the ſame hand, that there laid us, that muſt remove us, or elſe it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be to our Comfort.

The Sickle of Death will make the Stubble eeven and levell, albeit whileſt the Corn grew in the Field, one Ear might be higher and weightier than another; and this may keep us from murmuring and repining.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God, who gives to one more, and another leſs, gives none of thine; he diſpoſeth of his own: And as the Houſholder ſaid to the murmuring Servant, Is it not lawfull for me to do with my own what I will? <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15. So, Is it not lawful for God to diſpoſe of that which he hath infinitely more Right unto, than thou haſt, or canſt have to any Penny in thy Purſe? And in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a greater Eſtate than thou haſt in this World, thou deſireſt that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63725:33"/>which thou haſt no right unto: Thy eye may not be evill becauſe His is good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whatſoever thou haſt is God's free-Gift, and not by thee deſerved: Now, Wouldſt thou not think him to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Beggar, who craving an Alms, will yet preſcribe his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, what, and how much, he ſhall beſtow upon him? Such is thy Caſe, who repineſt againſt God; for that he hath given other men more, and not thee as much as they. <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 4.7. and that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will nothing ſatisfy you, unleſs you have ſome Great Man's Place or Pallace, thy wealthy Neighbour's Lands and Means? God ſees thy little to be beſt for thee, ſeeing thy Ability and Opportunity is but to make Uſe of a little.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Thou haſt never a whit the leſs, for that others have more; had they a far leſs Portion of worldly Goods than they have, thy Stock and Store would not at all be encreaſed thereby: For it is not for any want in God that he giveth ſo unequally, he hath enough for all; but he knows what is beſt for every one.

            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:63725:33"/>
            <p>I do not ſay, that of neceſſity it muſt be ſo; (for a man may be very rich and very good withall, as was <hi>Abraham,</hi> in whoſe boſom poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay; ſo <hi>Iſaac, Jacob,</hi> and other of the Patriarchs; ſo <hi>Job, Solomon, Obadiah:</hi> And, in the New Teſtament, <hi>Matthew, Zachaeus, Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and others.) But this is that I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for a truth unto you, That it is poſſible for a man to abound with earthly Riches, and vet ſo be a very wicked man. Many places in the Old Teſtament and ſundry Texts in the New do ſpeak as much. I ſhall content my ſelf, and I hope to content you, with naming ſome few of thoſe many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Tabernacles of Robbers proſper, and they that provoke God are ſecure; into whoſe hand God bringeth abundantly,</hi> Job 12.6. and ſpeaking elſe-where of their great Proſperity, which he ſets forth at large; he confeſſeth ingenuouſly, that it was ſuch, that the very conſideration thereof, did ſo vex and diſquiet him, as that his very Fleſh trembled thereat, <hi>Job</hi> 21.6,—16. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of the wicked of the World, (ſuch as he puts into his Letany, deſiring God to deliver him from) tells us, <hi>That they have their Portion in this Life, and that God fills them with his hid Treaſures;</hi> that is, the Riches of the Earth, Gold and Silver, which are hid in the mines of the Earth; and that they are full of Children, and leave their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to their Babes; they did abound with the choyſeſt of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and outward Bleſſings, for their future Judgment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. And in another place <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. he acknowledgeth that he could hardly keep his feet from ſlipping, and himſelf from falling, when he beheld the great proſperity of the Wicked, who were ſo pampered with the Pleaſures and Delicacies of this Life, as that their very eyes ſtood out with fatneſs, ver. 7. Their proſperity he ſets forth at large, together with their wicked Lives, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Behold, theſe are the ungodly who prosper in the World, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Riches,</hi> ver. 12, To theſe Proofs, we may add other; as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.6, 14. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.12.</p>
            <p>Proofs of the Point from the New Teſtament are not wanting, if the Old diſlike. St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of ſome that were Rich, yet they were great Oppreſſors in his Dayes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.6. And he calls upon rich men to weep and howl for the miſeries that ſhould befall them, Chap. 5.1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That not many Noble, not many Mighty, &amp;c.</hi> are called: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. He doth not exclude all;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63725:34"/>but the greateſt part of the Rich and Mighty of the World ſeems to be excluded, by the Saying of our bleſſed Saviour himſelf, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing a Wo againſt many that were Rich, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.24. and tells us plainly, <hi>That it is a very hard matter for a rich man to be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 19.23, 24.</p>
            <p>Now for Examples that might be brought both out of the Old Teſtament and New, whereby the Truth may be yet farther cleared; they are very many, as of <hi>Eſau, Nabal, Ahab, Saul Herod, Demas,</hi> and that rich Glutton, mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. All Rich, yet Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Humane Hiſtory, as well as Sacred, doth abound with Examples; as of <hi>Nero, Commodus, Heliogabalus, Croeſus,</hi> and many other Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours. And who at this day doth more abound in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Riches than Turk and Pope? But I ſhall not husband my time ſo well in being large in the Proof of what will be readily granted and experience verifies, as in laying down the grounds of the Point, and applying of it; which I now haſten unto.</p>
            <p>The Grounds or Reaſons of the Point are many: I ſhall acquaint you with three which are the principal. The firſt, reſpects the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or Beſtower of earthly Riches; The ſecond hath reſpect to the Nature of theſe things beſtowed; The third ariſeth from the effect which theſe earthly things produce: Of each, briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> God is the principal Diſpoſer of all earthly Riches, and He is a bountiful and liberal Donor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. He giveth us all things richly to enjoy, to one as well as to another: He gives to the godly as well as to the wicked, and oftentimes to them more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>And this he doth, that his bounty may be made known to all; yea, even to the very worſt: and how ready is he to recompence Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Service with Temporal Bleſſings? (as he recompenſed <hi>Jehu</hi>): he will not give any occaſion to a wicked perſon to ſay that, he dies in his debt.</p>
            <p>Sometimes indeed they are given in anger, and they are reſerved to the hurt of the Owner, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. And indeed that which God ſpeaks of ſome wicked men, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſpoken of all <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>I will curſe your Bleſſings.</hi> Yet in themſelves they are evidences of God's bounty, and God would that we ſhould ſo apprehend them. Some Jews have a tradition of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63725:34"/>
               <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that when he was advanced in <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court, and made Governour of the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he cauſed the Chaff, which aroſe from the Wheat, which he ſtored up, to be caſt down the River, to let the Nations know of the abundance of Grain that was in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> Certainly, God is pleaſed to beſtow plenty of Riches on the worſt of men; Chaff on Sinners, that we may from thence conclude of the glorious Recompence that is prepared for his Saints in Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6, 7.</p>
            <p>But albeit God be the principal Diſpoſer of all, the Devil is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes inſtrumentally active in conferring of them: We read of a Challenge that he made ſo the whole World, and the Glory of it, pretending that the right of Collating and Conferring thoſe things was in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.6, 7. But it was untrue: for when or where did God ever paſs over his Right to him? Indeed God is pleaſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to permit him to diſpoſe of Riches, and of the Glories of the World, for ſome Reaſons beſt known to himſelf; as, for the tryal of the Good, puniſhment of the Bad, and the Glory of his own Name in both: (but this his Connivence is no Conveyance, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is no Commiſſion granted to him). Now when Sathan hath this Permiſſion from God, to diſpoſe of Riches, Honors, &amp;c. he diſpoſeth of them to thoſe that do him the beſt Service, and prefers his own Chaplains; as he did <hi>Hildebrand, Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and many others to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair: one enters his Seat by murther, another by conjuring, others by Bribery and Simony And as <hi>Platina</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Silveſter's</hi> the third coming to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Vit.

               </note> ſaith, <hi>He which can moſt prevail in ſuch diſhoneſt Courſes, ſhall be ſooneſt preferred;</hi> good men being oppreſſed and rejected. And as he prefers his to Spiritual Promotions, ſo to Temporal Dignities; as we read, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.21. By Flatteries, a vile perſon ſhall come in and obtain the Kingdom; which is underſtood of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Many Crowns, Kingdoms, and Dignities have been obtained by ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and indirect means. So other worldly Profits muſt be obtained from him by fraud and falſhood; <hi>Achan</hi> ſhall have a Babyloniſh Garment of the faſhion, but he muſt ſteal it. <hi>Ahab</hi> a convenient Garden-plat joyned to his Palace, but he muſt ſhed <hi>Naboth</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood, and then he ſhall have it. <hi>Judas,</hi> mony in his purſe, but he muſt earn it by giving his Maſter a treacherous Kiſs. Let a man ye, ſwear, forſwear, and Wealth ſhall flow in upon him, if the Devil
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63725:35"/>can help it: But if a man will be upright in his wayes, keep a good conſcience in all his actions; make ſcruple of an Oath, of a Lye, of a Cheat; that man ſhall never be Rich in this World, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil can hinder it. This the very Heathens obſerved, and therefore fained, that when <hi>Plutus,</hi> which they held to be Riches, was ſent from <hi>Jupiter,</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> he limped and went, ſlowly; but when he was ſent from <hi>Pluto,</hi> whom they held to be the god of Hell, he did ever run, and was upon the ſpeed: by which fiction of theirs, they intended as much as is now delivered. That Speech which a Senatour of <hi>Rome</hi> ſometimes uſed to <hi>Sylla,</hi> (who vaunted and boaſted much of himſelf in the Senate) maketh much to this purpoſe. <hi>How can you be</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>a good man, who having little or nothing left you by your Father, in ſo ſhort a time are become ſo exceeding rich?</hi> This is the firſt Reaſon I bring to prove, that a man may be very wealthy, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Riches, and yet be very wicked.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> Secondly, If we look upon Riches and worldly abundance, in regard of their Nature; that which hath been delivered, will appear to be moſt true. For we deny not, but theſe earthly things are the good Gifts of God; and as they proceed from him, who is the Fountain of all Goodneſs, they are in their own nature Good (as hereafter we ſhall ſhew you in a more proper place); yet they are not abſolutely and immutably good, but of an indifferent Nature, ſubject to alter their Nature, according as they are uſed. So that they become good to thoſe that uſe them well, and evil to thoſe who abuſe them unto Sin: Nor are they able ſo better a man by adding any eſſential Goodneſs unto him, as the riches of Grace do, (ſo that he who hath them, muſt needs be bettered and made good by them.) But as a gilt Saddle and Bridle make not the Horſe the better, no more do Riches (of themſelves) make a man the happier. That which betters a man, muſt be better than himſelf; but the things of this World are not ſo excellent, they are far inferiour unto him; things that God hath placed under his Feet,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.6.</note> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks: ſhewing thereby, that there is not any ſuch worth nor excellency in them, as ſome men conceive. Conſidering then the nature of Wealth, and earthly Riches, that they are ſuch as do not, cannot, of themſelves, better him that hath them; It is not to be wondered at, that, A man may be wealthy, yet wicked withall.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> Thirdly and Laſtly, Take notice of the Effects that are produced
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63725:35"/>by them, though not naturally, yet accidentally, through man's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; Who ſees not daily, that they become hinderances of much good, and occaſions of much evil? In which reſpect our bleſſed Saviour compares them unto Thorns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.7, 22. and thoſe you know have two ſpecial properties. Firſt, they ſtop up the way, and hinder the growth of Corn: Secondly, they prick and pierce the hands of ſuch as have to deal with them, if they be not the better fenced. Thus Riches they choak the ſeed of the Word, and of all ſaving Grace, and barr up the way, as it were, to God's Kingdom: You have an example of this in <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> Auditors, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. And another, in that young man that came to Chriſt, and enquired of him the way to Heaven, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.22. Thoſe Gueſts that were invited to the great Supper, ſet leight by it, only out of a reſpect that they had to their worldly Pleaſures and Profits, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. and that kept them from taſting of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. And experience ſhews, that of all men, rich men and worldlings are moſt backward to holy Duties. It may well be wondered at, that they having ſo long a Teddar, ſo much Liberty, ſo many fair Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to attend upon the means (which poor men want), yet are ſo rarely converted: But conſidering how eaſily Sathan can, by that teddar of Riches, draw them home again; or if in caſe they do not break the Rope, yet like ſome Jades that are ſeeding in the Corn, they are willing to be taken and tyed unto the Stake, the wonder ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>As they are hinderances to Good, ſo they are great provocations unto Evil: <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> calls Riches, <hi>Abſurditatis Parentes,</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Abſurdities; for that they cauſe a man to do not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, but inhumane things; not only irreligions, but things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and abſurd, which we our ſelves could not ſuſpect that we ſhould be ever drawn unto: They cauſe us to grow proud, ſecure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, and put a man upon the practiſe of thoſe Evils which would hardly enter into the heart of man, that ever they ſhould be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by us. They wound the Soul with many noyſom Luſts, as the Apoſtle ſheweth; and pierce us thorow with many Sorrows, 1 Tim. 6.9, 10. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle? <hi>Shall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, &amp;c?</hi> So ſaith the worldly covetous man (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>); They ſay in their hearts, albeit they ſay it not in their mouths, <hi>Quis nos ſeparabit cupiditate Auri?

But that Speech (ſay ſome) the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> utters in the perſon of a worldly man, who uſually ſaies ſo; therefore the Greek turneth it, They count that People bleſſed which are ſo; and is much like that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.24. <hi>There is nothing better for a man, then to eat and drink, and to make his Soul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy good in his Labour?</hi> Therefo e he corrects that ſaying, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own judgment therein, and oppoſeth true Happineſs unto it; <hi>yea, happy is that People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Others take the words, as ſpoken by <hi>David</hi> in his own perſon, and in reference to the People that live under a peaceable and happy Government, who are in ſome reſpect happy in the peace of the Kingdom, and immunity from the miſery of Wars by a Forraign or Domeſtick Enemy. Such a People are happy, but that happineſs is but a deficient happineſs, a happineſs that is defective, albeit in ſome reſpect a man may call it happineſs, but it comes far ſhort of true happineſs; and therefore <hi>David</hi> adds, <hi>yea, happy is that People,</hi> which words are ſpoken by way of Retractation: he ſeemeth to retract what went before, leſt worldly men ſhould wreſt it to a miſ-interpretation. 'Tis as if he ſhould ſay, Did I ſay
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63725:36"/>that thoſe were happy who are in ſuch a caſe? Miſtake me not, for thoſe that are only in ſuch a caſe, are nor compleatly happy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the World conceives: for true Happineſs, lies not in outward things, but in God; no bleſſedneſs, no happineſs can be had without God, who is eſſential Happineſs.</p>
            <p>That man's happineſs doth not conſiſt in any earthly thing, as Riches, Honor, Pleaſures, &amp;c. might be confirmed by ſundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The glorious Angels of Heaven have not them, yet they are happy. The end of man is better then man himſelf, but theſe are worſe then man; for a man for his Life would give the whole World, therefore his happineſs does not ly in them. Riches are not able to make a man good; how then are they able to make a man happy? They may denominate a man to be Great and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful, but not to be a vertuous or a godly man. They are ſo far from making a man good, that they often make him evil; and poſſeſs the heart with vile affections, and fill it full of carnal and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires: But I cannot ſtay upon theſe things: only I deſire you to rectify your judgments in this Point; think not your ſelves, nor any other, ever a whit the more happy ſimply for Riches. Happineſs is the end you are to aym at: but if all your ayms are at Wealth, and think to be happy in the enjoying that, you take your aym amiſs. Our bleſſed Saviour in his Sermon upon the Mount, treates of true Happineſs,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> on the Beat.</note> and he ſets the Crown of true bleſſedneſs upon many things, as there you read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. he begins with Poverty, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit,</hi> and ſo proceeds. But you read not there, no, nor any where elſe, That he ſaith, Bleſſed are the Rich, Bleſſed are the Wealthy, Bleſſed are the Mighty, Bleſſed are the Witty, &amp;c. Could you read that in any of his Sermons, or in the whole Book of God, you might have ſomewhat to confirm yourſelvs in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you are Happy becauſe Wealthy; but that you do not. If Gold and Silver be your happineſs, then your happineſs lies in the Earth, and ſo your happineſs is nearer Hell then Heaven; for Hell is placed in the Deep, and Heaven is aloft, as we all know, and ſo happineſs ſhould be nearer to the Devil than to God.</p>

               </label> The Earth is a fruitful Mother; ſhe hath a fruitful Womb, and brings forth abundantly for the good of man.</p>
            <p>This is a Point which might profitably be enlarged and applyed, but I ſhall briefly diſpatch it.</p>
            <p>Should we examine what is in the Womb or Entrails of this our common Mother Earth, we ſhould find there is Riches and much Treaſure, of which we may read, <hi>Job</hi> 28.1,—12. Rich Minerals are her Veins; ſhe hath a Vein of Silver, another of Gold, another of Braſs, and Iron, which is molten out of her; ſhe hath ſtones of Saphires, and duſt of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ver. 6. Theſe and the like are within the Earth; called a hid Treaſure, for that it is within the Earth, and hidden from our Eyes. <hi>Adams</hi> on <hi>Peter.</hi> 1172. Our Text leads us to a conſideration of ſuch as are upon the Earth, and brought forth by her, and well known and ſeen; and, more particularly, the Vegetables, that is, the Plants that grow upon the Earth, as Graſs, Grain, Herbs, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Variety whereof who is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, either for kinds, colours, ſmell, taſte, greatneſs, vertue, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> All which come from the ſame Womb, and grow on the ſame Clod of Earth, and are brought forth for the Uſe of Man; ſome to feed him, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Job.</hi> 28.5. ſome to delight him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.10, 15. and ſome to heal his Diſeaſes, and cure his Wounds, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.22.

Fruitful Countries make full Barns.</note> Let us acknowledg God's Goodneſs to us, who notwithſtanding our Sins great and many which brought the Curſe upon the Earth, yet he is graciouſly pleaſed ſo to heal the Womb of it (as he did the Womb of <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Houſhold), that albeit it come far ſhort of what it was before the Fall, yet it is both willing and able by the help of Induſtry (that good Mid-wife), to bring forth, and that plentifully, for the good of Man. And more than this, God hath taught Man the Skill and Power, by ſetting, ſowing, plowing, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, Inſition, Inoculation, in due ſeaſon to do the Office of a Mid-wife to the Earth, that it may bring forth, as we have it excellently ſet forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.23,—30.

            <p>When <hi>Lamech</hi> begat a Son, he called his Name <hi>Noah</hi> (which ſignifies Reſt); and he gives the Reaſon, <hi>For this Son ſhall comfort us concerning the Work and Toyl of our hands, becauſe of the Ground which the Lord hath curſed,</hi> Gen. 5.29. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> thinks that <hi>Lamech</hi> hoped, that this Son of his ſhould have been that promiſed Seed, who ſhould reſtore the Earth to its former Eſtate, ſo that it ſhould bring forth Fruit without Man's Labour, as it did at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; but therein he was deceived. But this may be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that by our Labour and Induſtry we ſhall enjoy the Fruits of the Earth, and through Holineſs; and Well-doing, the Earth curſed for out Sins ſhall in ſome meaſure recover her ſtrength to bring forth and yield her encreaſe.</p>
            <pb n="63" facs="tcp:63725:44"/>
            <p>You may think it to be very incongruous to read a Lecture of Husbandry to Husbandmen, as it was for <hi>Phormio</hi> a Philoſopher to entertain <hi>Hannibal</hi> with a Lecture of Warlick Diſcipline; which being ended, and every one admiring the old man's Dexterity in ſo ſtrange a Faculty, <hi>Hannibal</hi> being asked what he thought of him, anſwered, That he had ſeen many doting old men, but more than <hi>Phormio</hi> never any; <hi>&amp; merito ſane</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi>), deſervedly enough: For, What could be a matter of greater Folly than for a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who never ſaw a Camp, nor beheld an Enemy, to diſcourſe of Military matters before ſo great a Souldier and worthy a Captain as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was. But in keeping myſelf to the Rules of Scripture and acquainting you with thoſe Directions which the Word holds forth for the proſpering of the Fruits of the Earth, I ſhall keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bounds of my own Calling, in inſtructing you Husbandmen whom God doth inſtruct and would have to be inſtructed how to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Earth's Fruitfulneſs.</p>
            <p>God himſelf hath laid down ſundry Rules for your Direction herein which I might by Warrant of my Doctrine preſs upon you, but I will but point at them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you would have good Crops, keep God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and obey his Word, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.13. &amp; 28. If you deceive God, the Earth will deceive you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be diligent in your Callings, and not ſloathful and careleſs. <hi>In all Labour there is much profit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 14.23. This the Sons of that Husbandman found, who being told by him that there was Gold hid in his Vineyard, after he was dead fell to digging for it, but they found not that Gold which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet the next year they had a rich Crop, which brought them in much Gold, which was that the Father intended. <hi>A ſloathfull Perſon cauſeth the Earth to be ſloathfull through his Sluggiſhneſs,</hi> Prov. 24.30, 31. God ſtretcheth out his hand as we do; we to labour, he to bleſs our Labours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By Prayer ſeek a Bleſſing from God upon your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I ſhall relate to you what I have heard to his purpoſe, There was a very great Husbandman, who had a good Farm, yet but mean Crop: Another that dwelt near him had a him had a mean Farm, nor did he take that pains with his Ground that the other did, yet had always a rich Crop: The rich Neighbour meeting with the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63725:45"/>other, asked him, How he ordered his Ground, that he had ſuch a great Encreaſe, when he whoſe Ground was better, and Pains grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could ſometimes ſcarce ſee his Seed again: O Neighbour (ſaid the other), you do not well ſteep your Seed, as I do, before you ſow it. Steep it? in what (ſaid the rich Farmer)? In Prayer, ſaid the other: Do but that, and your Crop will be better. And indeed <hi>David</hi> hath taught us, That it is in vain ſo riſe early, or go to Bed late, to eat the Bread of Carefulneſs, unleſs God bleſs our Labours: It is God only that maketh the Earth fruitful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2.</p>
            <p>But in praying to God for a Bleſſing, limit not God to what ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you pleaſe. Biſhop <hi>Babington</hi> relate a Story out of <hi>Holcot</hi> to this purpoſe, of a Hermit, who having ſowed Pot-herbs in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, deſired ſometimes fair weather and ſometimes foul weather, granted, as he deſired, but none of his Herbs came up: Whereupon, he thought that there was a general failing of ſuch Herbs in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, till one day walking to another Hermit not far off, he ſaw in his Garden a ſingular good Crop: Then he told him what he had done concerning the Weather, and what ſucceſs it had; whereupon the other Hermit anſwered him, Thou thoughteſt thy ſelf wiſer than God, and he hath ſhewed thee thy Folly therein; I, for my part, never deſired of God other weather than he ſhould pleaſe to ſend, <hi>Babing</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> c. 16. p. 313. I would we would learn of that Hermit and ſubmit unto his Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Give God the Praiſe of all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67.5, 6. <hi>Let the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple praiſe thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then ſhall the Earth yield her encreaſe, and God, even our God ſhall bleſs us.</hi> And how God will be honoured and praiſed, is more particularly ſhewed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy Encreaſe.</hi> Seeing it is he that giveth Encreaſe to all things, it is the leaſt Tribute we can pay him to honour him with the firſt-Fruits of them. This brings the Bleſſing of God upon all our Subſtance; For, in ſo doing (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) <hi>Thy Barns ſhall be filled with Plenty, and thy Preſſes ſhall burst with new Wine.</hi> And what is there promiſed, you find performed 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.10. <hi>Since the Prieſts began to bring their Offerings into the Houſe of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Azariah</hi> the Chief-Prieſt to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>), we have enough to eat, and have left plenty; for the Lord hath bleſſed his
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63725:45"/>People, and that which is left, is this great ſtore. To give to God, is not to give away, as the Worldling thinks, but to receive more: The Jews Proverb was, Tythe and be Rich. We cannot believe it: <hi>But prove it and try it,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>if I will not open the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and powre you out a Bleſsing, that there ſhall not he room enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</hi> You may read to whom God's ſpeaks this, and upon what occaſion, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, Beware of hard uſage of Servants and Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers imployed about the Fruits of the Earth. For this will bring up the Thiſtles in Head of Wheat, and Cockle in ſtead of Barley, as we read, <hi>Job</hi> 31.39, 40.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> There is yet another Uſe that might be made of the Point: For <hi>Job</hi> ſends us to the Earth to be inſtructed and taught, <hi>Job</hi> 12.8. <hi>Speak to the Earth, and it ſhall teach thee</hi> (ſaith he), So ſay I, And what will it teach us? It may inſtruct us what we are, Earth; and ſtand in need of, the Rain of Heaven; and what we ſhould be. So <hi>Paul</hi> urgeth from the fruitfulneſs of the Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The Earth that drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet, for the Dreſſer receiveth bleſſing from God.</hi> The Apoſtle reaſons from the leſs to the greater: If the Earth that is painfully tilled, and hath many ſweet Showers fallen upon it, brings forth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Herbs and other Fruits ſo anſwer the pains of the Husbandman, and requite the coſt and charges that hath been beſtowed on it; then much more ought we who are likewiſe Earth (though moving) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo many ſweet Showers from Heaven, and having all the helps for Fruitfulneſs. It's the example of the Earth, to bring forth Fruit unto God, that we may receive a Bleſſing from him. <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, hear the word of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>It ſeems by this, That this man's Wealth came in an honeſt way unto him; he got it not by oppreſſion, or forged cavillation (as may be thought <hi>Zacheus</hi> got much of his); but even in thoſe things which God by the hand of Nature did reach forth unto him, he became a mighty man of Wealth. Thence we may inferr in the firſt place, that,</p>
            <p>Outward Bleſſings are given by God unto the Wicked out of a general way of providence, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>God's providence is of a large extent, it reacheth both to Man
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63725:46"/>and Beaſt, as <hi>David</hi> ſhews, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. And as God preferrs the one, ſo he doth the other, (even ſuch men, as he had in the former part of the Pſalm deſcribed wicked and ungodly men) at which he cannot but admire. But all temporal Bleſſings are given unto them only <hi>ex largitate,</hi> out of that general Providence which cauſeth the Sun to ſhine, and the Rain to fall on the good and bad alike, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.45. The happy influences of Heaven are powred down upon the heads of Sinners, as well as on the heads of Saints. <hi>He is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his Work,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 145.9. <hi>He giveth to the very Beaſt his Food, and to the young Ravens when they cry,</hi> Pſal. 147.9.</p>
            <p>All this in a providential way; As he is the Suſtainer of Nature, and the Preſerver of the Creature, as hath been before ſhewed you; and it extends to all Natural things, chained together by a regular order of Succeſſion, as we read, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I will hear the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, they ſhall hear the Earth; The Earth ſhall hear the Corn, Wine, Oyl, and they ſhall hear</hi> Iezreel. How ſhould <hi>Iexreel</hi> live without Corn, Wine, and Oyl? How ſhould Corn, Wine, and Oyl be had without the yieldance of the Earth? How ſhould the Earth yield theſe, without the Influence of Heaven? How ſhould Heaven yield theſe Influences, without the Command of their Maker? All this is the Scale of providence, whereof no ſcale can be miſſing.</p>

               </label> Learn we from hence to diſtinguiſh betwixt Bleſſing and Bleſſing, Mercy and Mercy: The ſame thing in temporal and inferior Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings may belong to a wicked man, only out of that general provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence whereby all Creatures are upheld and preſerved in their Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And to a godly man another way, <hi>ex promſſo,</hi> out of God's Promiſe made unto them in Chriſt: For Godlineſs hath the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both of this Life, and that which is to come. To the godly they are ſent down the ladder which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw in his ſleep, whereon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſcended and deſcended; And though the Rain-bow, which is ſaid <hi>to compaſs about the Throne of God</hi> Rev. 4.3. But to the wicked they come about another way, the way of the Common: Now there is a vaſt difference betwixt theſe two, to have a Bleſſing only <hi>ex lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate,</hi> out of a general bounty and favour beſtowed on us, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us by the hand of Nature; And to have it beſtowed <hi>ex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſo,</hi> by vertue of a Promiſe. The former is clogged with many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, forfeitures, vexations, perplexities; which the latter is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63725:46"/>freed from. <hi>The Bleſſing of the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, it maketh Rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it,</hi> Prov. 10.22.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.22.</note> The drift of which Proverb, is to ſhew the pre-eminence that God's People have above the men of this World: The wicked uſually have more ſtore of Riches then the godly, and God ſeemeth to be more provident for Sinners then for his Saints; therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews the difference: Troubles and Vexation are intermingled with the goods of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſomuch that they were in a manner as good to be without them, as we find it verified in this Rich Man,<note place="margin">Eccl. 2.16.</note> that our Text ſpeaks of: but God's Servants are freed from thoſe incumbrances; God giveth them Wealth without Wo, Store without Sore. If it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that many good men have Troubles in their proſperous Eſtates, and do find much grief and perturbation in the enjoyment of theſe earthly things: I muſt anſwer you, that theſe Cares and Troubles grow meerly from their own infirmities; the Cook is in the fault for making ſowre ſauce to ſweet meat. So far as God doth give theſe things unto them, they are without ſorrow. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.9. God gives them for their good, and would they ſhould have good of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If any ſorrowr be added to them by God, yet it is to make us reliſh them the better; He will bleſs that ſorrow to them that are godly; and being a bleſſing to them, it cannot be well ſaid to be Sorrow. So that we may conclude with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 37.16. <hi>A little that the Righteous hath, is better then the Riches of many wicked men.</hi>

            <p>Goods may be ſaid to be well gotten,<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.10. &amp; 69, 22.</note> when they are lawfully come by; as by Inheritance, juſt Purchaſe, Free-gift honeſt Labour, ordinary and conſcionable courſe of Trading, fertility of the Ground, and the like. Now all theſe wayes a man may come by Wealth, and yet that Wealth prove pernitious to the Soul of the Owner, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13, 19. There is a ſore Evil which I have ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun; namely Riches kept for the Owners thereof to their hurt; he ſpeaks not of the getting of them, but of the keeping of them: that which they look to have happineſs by, is the occaſion of their miſery. And that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw, may be daily ſeen in the World; Riches well and honeſtly gotten, prove many times an occaſion of miſchief to the Owners.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wills <hi>Timothy</hi> to charge rich men with greateſt vehemency to beware of the abuſes of Riches, in being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, and truſting in them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. He neither condemns the getting of them, nor the enjoying of them, nor doth he diſalow their uſe; only he adviſeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to admoniſh, yea charge them, that they do not endanger their Souls through the abuſe thereof; which; were it not a thing poſſible to be done, that charge had been needleſs.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>James</hi> holds rich men in a terrible expectation of Vengeance, not for having Riches, but for the abuſe of them when they had them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet for a more evident proof of the Point (if thoſe produced like not) I ſhall commend unto you that Parable of the Gueſts invited to the wedding Feaſt; one excuſeth his not coming, for that he had bought a parcel of Land, as St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. or took a Farm as St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8. another bought five Yoke of Oxen, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.19.

And others who forbear to act Sin, and ſpeak lewdly; yet they give Liberty to Imagination to play with the Devil at what Game he will, at Murther, Theft, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when the Mark is out of their mouths, I mean, they are out of date in reſpect of the act of ſome Sin; yet they have ſtill an unſatiable deſire to it, and can pleaſe themſelvs in contemplative Wickedneſs, calling to mind their former brutiſh and luſtful practices with great delight, making their own hearts to be their Brothel-houſe, a Houſe of Bawdery and Uncleanneſs; and all upon this Deluſion that their Thoughts are free; and what is not lawful to act, nor fit to ſpeak, is lawful ſo think without Controul: Which Atheiſtical and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Opinion ariſeth from theſe Grounds;</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63725:51"/>
            <p>Firſt, Ignorance of the Law of God, and the Spiritualneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which commands the Soul with the motions of it, as well as the Body with the Actions thereof. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. <hi>It pierceth even to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the heart,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Now, they being carnall, and the Law ſpiritual, it is no marvel if they cannot underſtand it (for it muſt be ſpiritually underſtood). <hi>They have a Veil over their eyes,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.15. and, which is yet more, the god of this World hath further blinded them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. that they ſhall not diſcern the Spirituality of if. So were the Phariſees blinded in their time, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> all the while he was a Phariſee, <hi>Rom</hi> 7.7. They reſted only in the outward Rinde or Bark of the Law, but diſcerned not the pith and marrow of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, From the Defectiveneſs and Imperfection of Man's Law, which although it binds the Hands and ſtops the Mouth, yet it puniſheth not for Thoughts:<note place="margin">Cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis poenam nemo patia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> The Projects of the Heart lye not within the walk of Humane Juſtice, they are not liable to earthly Courts, they pay no Tribute to Man's Cuſtom-Houſe, where they cannot be ſearched, but as they bewray themſelvs by ſome outward Sign, either by Word or Deed; forgetting, that God ſeeth not as Man ſeeth, <hi>He hath an eye into our moſt ſecret Thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 139.12. <hi>He ſets our Thoughts in the Light of his Countenance,</hi> Pſal. 90.8. And if men call ſo account and puniſh Words and Deeds, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee and know them; Why then ſhall not God call to account, and puniſh too, our Thoughts, which he knows far better than any man can our Actions. That Man's Law puniſheth not for our Thoughts, proves rather a Defectiveneſs in Man's Law, than this Diabolical and Atheiſtical Opinion, that Thoughts are free.</p>
            <p>A third Ground for this graceleſs Opinion, is, That they do no hurt to any by their thinking, Why then may they not think what they pleaſe? But indeed they do the greateſt miſchief: they fight againſt the Soul, yea, <hi>thy own Soul,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. they tend to the Deſtruction of it. And from the Motions of thy mind proceeds all other Miſchiefs which are wrought, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet <hi>Michah</hi> is worthy to be believed, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.1. or the Apoſtle St. <hi>James</hi> to be credited, <hi>James</hi> 4.1. or if Chriſt himſelf may be believed of us, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.16, 17. Indeed alwayes the Luſts of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63725:52"/>Heart are not actually prejudicial to our Neighbour; for here a man may be an Adulteret, and the Woman chaſte with whom Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is committed: a man may be a Murtherer, and yet the man alive whom he is the Murtherer of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But many times theſe Thoughts come into Act: What Wickedneſs is committed in Act that was not firſt in the Thought?</p>
            <p>A fourth Ground for this Deviliſh and Helliſh conceipt, ariſeth from the ſuddenneſs and unexpectedneſs of their coming, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to avoid them. No Reaſon many times can be given of them; Therefore there is no Reaſon (ſay ſome, and more think), why they ſhould be called to any Account for them. But all the Thoughts that are in the hearts of Sinners, are, either Suggeſtions by Inſpiration from Satan; or Vapours that fume out of corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from our ſinful hearts. How can it be otherwiſe then, but that they ſhould be offenſive unto God?</p>
            <p>Beſides, their ſuddenneſs and exorbitancy proves them evil. All Good is from knowledg, deliberation, and direction; Did they come in God's Name they would come a ſlower pace, as they find by ſad experience, who ſet their minds ſo think of matters ſerious and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
            <p>And what though we cannot avoid thoſe wandring and ſinful Thoughts altogether, Muſt we therefore ſet open the door and give them free liberty of Ingreſs, Egreſs, and Regreſs? No man can keep the Birds from flying over his head, but I hope he may keep them from making their Neſts on that Tuft of haire which he wears.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Men imagine Thoughts to be free, becauſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of the World and general Eſtimate of Religion, which is not by the Heart and Thoughts, but by our outward Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wherein if we approve our ſelves before men, it is all that is ſought after; forgetting what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>You are they which approve your ſelves to men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.11.</note> 
               <hi>but they who are approved of by men may be Abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> Men indeed judge of our Thoughts by our Words and Actions; but God, of our Words and Works by our Thoughts. No outward Works ſo good and holy, but Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites have at ſome times done them: And few outward Works or none ſo evil, but ſome godly men at ſome times through Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation have fallen into them. But how like ſoever ſuch Works whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63725:52"/>good or bad, have been in the face; yet the difference is great in the heart of the Doer, which is that God diſtinguiſheth the one from the other by: Of which anon we ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat more.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Grounds of this Conceipt which mens hearts are poſſeſſed with, That Thoughts are free, and they have liberty to think what they liſt, which opens a doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to all Impiety; For, if Thought be free, all will be free in the end. Such ſhew what their Actions would be, if they dared to act them: But, <hi>Do they not err that imagine evill?</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 14.22. Which Queſtion is not put, by way of Doubt, as if it were uncertain whether ſuch erred or not; but that Interrogation is a confident Aſſeveration, They do err out of the wayes of Life, that think evil in their hearts. Say not then, That Thoughts are free; you have heard the contrary proved, and that upon good Grounds and undeniable Reaſons; and withall, the weak Grounds that are brought ſo this wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, which is in many mens minds; which (I hope) may ſerve to convince any of their Error that are ſo minded. The Truth is, ſo far are Thoughts from being free, as that they may in ſome Caſes prove unpardonable, as St <hi>Peter</hi> intimates in that Speech of his which he uſed to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8.22. <hi>Pray God, if perhaps the Thought of thine Heart may be forgiven thee:</hi> There was but a <hi>Perhaps</hi> in it, no Certainty. As the Thoughts of the Heart have been more or leſs active to plot and contrive Sin, the more or leſs difficultly is a pardon obtained of it. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>

               <hi>Job</hi> 9.20, 21. <hi>If thou haſt done fooliſhly</hi> (as without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion thou haſt often done, in lifting up thy ſelf) <hi>or it thou haſt thought evil</hi> (ſaith <hi>Agur</hi>), <hi>lay thine hand upon thy mouth;</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, If in caſe thou haſt outwardly ſinned through Pride, in word or deed; or, if thou haſt thought evil and conceived miſchief in thy mind, never ſo cloſely and ſecretly; then, <hi>Manum ad Os,</hi> let thine hand be laid to thy mouth, plead not chine own Innocency, but be humbled before God, and repent thee of thy Wickedneſs from the bottom of thy heart; for in that ſenſe the Phraſe of <hi>laying the hand upon the mouth</hi> is uſed, <hi>Job</hi> 40.4.</p>
            <p>In the Performance of this Duty whereto you are now exhorted, See, firſt, That you take a diligent Survey of your hearts, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, That Thoughts of all ſorts are in every man's mind by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>We read, that when God called his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to the Door, and willed him ſo digg through the Wall, and enter in at the Door; he was no ſooner entred, but <hi>he ſaw in the Chambers of the Houſe every Form of creeping things, and all ſorts of abominable Beaſts,</hi> Ezek. 8.7, 8, 9. Look into thy heart, that <hi>Chamber of thy Belly,</hi> as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> phraſeth it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8. and there thou ſhalt eſpy, not onely creeping things in abundance, ſuch as are all idle, fooliſh, frothy, earthly, wanton, and vain Thoughts, which like Motes in the Sun fly up and down, or, like Ants in a Mole-hill, run to and fro in thy mind hourly; but many abominable Beaſts, ſuch as are Thoughts of Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, Murther, Adultery, Pride, Revenge, and ſuch like, thou mayeſt there diſcover; which lodge and lye in thy polluted heart, and there revell it day and night, finding too friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment. Unleſs theſe be diſcovered (which is no hard matter to do), they will never be diſlodged and unrooſted. This is that which muſt be done that thou mayeſt be truly humbled, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes</hi> (that is, both our hearts and lives) <hi>and ſo turn again to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Lament and bewail the Vileneſs and Wickedneſs of thy heart in the ſight of God. So did the Church, <hi>We have ſpoken
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63725:53"/>Cruelty and Oppreſſion, conceiving and uttering out of the heart falſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Iſa. 59.13. And this is that which God required of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thy heart from Wickedneſs that thou mayeſt be ſaved;</hi> which is in effect the ſame that is required by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean,</hi> &amp;c. and by St. James, Cleanſe your hands you Sinners, and purify your hearts you dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded men,</hi> Jam. 4.8. where, by <hi>hands,</hi> the outward Actions, and by <hi>hearts,</hi> the inward Cogitations; the one defiled by doing Evil, the other, by thinking Evil, are to be underſtood. And that we might not miſtake his meaning, in the words following he ſhews what a Waſhing and Cleanſing, both of the one and the other, he intendeth; <hi>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep,</hi> Ver. 9. Humble your ſelvs before God, by godly Sorrow: This Mourning for the Sinfulneſs of our hearts, is termed Waſhing; for that as the Filth of the Body is done away by Water, ſo is the Filth of the Heart, by true Remorſe and godly Mourning for it. It is true, that the Blood of Chriſt, and that only, cleanſeth the Soul from Sin, (both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Guilt, which is our Juſtification; and in regard of Filth, which is our Sanctification) <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. 1. <hi>John</hi> 1.7. But this Waſhing of Sanctification requires a double Act; the one, of God himſelf, in the firſt Converſion and Renovation of a Sinner, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.25. and therein Man is meerly a Patient: The other, of Man, cleanſing himſelf yet more and more, through the Power of God's bleſſed Spirit, by Repentance; and therein Man is inſtrumentally an Agent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Chriſt's Blood is the Cauſe of the one, for without it there is no Remiſſion; and by our mourning and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for Sin, the Soul is qualified and brought into ſuch an Eſtate, that it may be capable of the benefit of his Death.</p>
            <p>That we may be cleanſed then from our ſpiritual defilements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by our ſinful Thoughts, let us waſh our hearts; often ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe is not enough, the Devil with all his unclean Spirits likes well of the Houſe that is ſwept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44. but he likes not the Houſe that is throughly waſhed. Nor is it enough to ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle our hearts with a little Water, to ſend forth a Sigh, or ſhed a Tear or two: It muſt be a making clean with Waſhing. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16. a thorow-Waſhing is required. We do as good as nothing in the buſineſs, if we exceed not; weeping bitterly with <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26.75.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63725:54"/>waſhing the very feet of Chriſt with Tears, as did <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> Luke 7.38. We uſe to pour moſt Water upon that which moſt defileth us; and our Thoughts are, if not the only yet the principal defilers of the inward man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.18, 19.</p>

Unleſs there be a leaving; and forſaking of them, we deceive our ſelves, in thinking that we have truly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and repented for them. Now, in this Work of Reformation, we muſt begin where our Sin began, and that is in the heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are called upon to begin with that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. That man (ſaith a very judicious Doctor) that takes no notice of his Sin till it come into Act,<note place="margin">Dr. Donn.</note> doth poſt-date his Sin, and begins his Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too late. It is the firſt time (ſay ſome, when they are taken in the Act) that I did it, when indeed it was not the firſt by an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: For, when the firſt conceived that Sin in the heart, then they did it; and in every Diſcourſe, Wiſh, or Dream that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to that Sin, or that riſeth from the Thought of that Sin, they ſin it over again before they come to the actual Committing of it, which is the Nativity of it; out you muſt reckon from the Conception of it. As <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. ſo muſt you do in this Caſe, and begin Reformation there: Never think to have reformed Lives, before you have reformed Hearts and Thoughts. It was the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Phariſee in Chriſt's time, to make clean the out-ſide of the Cup and Platter, and leave the in-ſide foul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.25. Chriſt reproves them for that, and gives them directions where to begin firſt, <hi>Cleanſe that which is within, that the out-ſide may be clean alſo,</hi> Ver. 26.</p>
            <p>Now, That we may carry on this Work comfortably and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, I ſhall proceed in my Application of the Point, with an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatory Direction, commending unto you ſome Motives to ſtir up your care about your Thoughts; and then preſcribe unto you ſome Rules to be followed, whereby you may be enabled to bring your Thoughts under ſubjection to the Government of Chriſt.

Why, <hi>all things are naked and open before him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13. This ſhould move you to look to your Thoughts, and have a care of your inward diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Remember that as God knows the thoughts, ſo he ponders them, Prov. 21.2. <hi>The Lord ponders the heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> He weighs them, and diſcovers what ſubſtance is in them: And for this end he doth it, that he may give to every one the Fruit of them, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews, Prov. 24 12. <hi>Doth not he that pondereth the heart, conſider it;</hi> — <hi>and ſhall not he render to every man, according to his Works?</hi> Thy Thoughts he puts into one ballance, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence into the other, and gives weight for weight; For good Thoughts, a good Recompence; as <hi>David</hi> found, who had it in his heart ſo build a Houſe unto the Lord, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.18.

This ſhould make us careful of our thoughts, as well as of our words and actions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It would be remembred, that God expects to have his Glory ſhine in our Thoughts, as well as in our outward Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is from him that we have our Souls, and all the powers of it (as well as our Bodies, with the members thereof); He hath planted them in us, and he looks to taſte of the Fruit of thoſe Trees that he hath planted. It is he that hath redeemed the Soul as well as the Body, and looks to be glorified both in Soul and Body by us: He hath a Soveraignty over the whole man, his Law binds both Soul and Body, and both muſt be yielded up to be governed by him. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all the heart, with all the Soul, and with all the Mind,</hi> is the Law, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.27. Now in giving way to any evil thought, we turn God out of our hearts at that time; the heart is not then for God, but taken up for the ſervice of the World, Fleſh, or Devil: we bring not forth Fruit to God, but to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Enemies of our Salvation: Chriſt was angry with that Figg-Tree that grew by the way ſide, when he, being hungry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, found nothing but Leaves upon it, inſomuch that he curſed it, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee any more,</hi> Matth: 21.18, 19. So, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the garden of thy Soul, and finding little or nothing growing upon the beſt Tree there, thy Mind and Underſtanding, but empty and looſe imaginations at the beſt; thou mayſt be aſſured he will be ſo provoked by thee, as that he will paſs ſome ſore and ſevere Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt thee. Let this prevail with thee, to look unto thy thoughts that they be not ſinful.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God eſteems himſelf highly honoured by us, when care is had that we diſhonour him not in Thought; when we ſo regard his all-ſeeing Eye, as that we will not offend him in taking liberty ſo much as to offend him in thinking any thing that may diſpleaſe him, albeit man can take no notice thereof; this is to ſanctify God in our hearts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. And ſuch as do thus, God eſteems as his Jewels, and hath promiſed to preſerve them ſafe, as his ſpecial Treaſure, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17. And thus you have heard, how, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, we ought to make conſcience of our Thoughts and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63725:56"/>Cogitations: Next, in reference to our ſelves, the like care ſhould be taken. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By admitting of ſinful Thoughts into our hearts, we become defiled and polluted, and are made as loathſome Lepers in the Eyes of God, Matth. 15.18, 19. <hi>Thoſe things which come from the heart, as evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, &amp;c. they defile the man.</hi> Where, our Saviour doth not ſpeak only of actual Murther and Adultery, but of the ſinful diſpoſition of the Soul; theſe are they that defile the Spirit of man in God's ſight, who looks upon them with a more hateful Eye, than any mortal Creature can look upon any thing loathſome with the eye of his Body. <hi>The Thoughts of the Wicked are an domination unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.26. Not only abominable and loathſome, but abomination it ſelf in the Abſtract: Nor are all our actual ſins committed by us in the Body, ſimply conſidered in themſelves, and committed by the Body, ſo hateful unto God as the pollution of the Spirit is. Hear the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a very judicious and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arned Divine in the Point,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preſt.</hi> on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trib. <hi>2.7.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>I dare be bold to ſay,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that though the Act contracts the Guilt,</hi> (becauſe the Luſt is then grown up to a height, ſo that it is come to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will and execution); <hi>yet the act of Adultery and Murther is not ſo abominable in God's Eyes, as the filthineſſe of the Spirit.</hi> Indeed when Thoughts break forth into Words and Actions, and command the outward man, it argues, that Luſt hath a more full dominion and ſoveraignty over a man, than when it reſts in the Thoughts and Heart; and in breaking out, it doth more diſhonour God, and doth more hurt unto Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. in which regard, it is worſe to ſpeak and do evil, than to think evil: But, actual Sins being ſimply conſidered in themſelves (as was ſaid before), are not ſo odious nor abominable in the Eyes of Almighty God, as is the filthineſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of the Spirit; for that God is a Spirit, and it is the Spirit that he mainly looks upon. In which reſpect, our care ſhould be to keep our Spirit clean from theſe defilements by wicked Thoughts; if we would not be naſty, loathſome, and abominable Creatures in the Eyes and Noſtrils of the Lord God Almighty, who is of purer Eyes than to take any content in the Heart and Spirit of ſuch as are ſo defiled.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In entertaining ſinful Thoughts, we make our hearts a Lodge and Harbor for Rebels and Traytors, which conſpire againſt the Crown and Dignity of the King of Heaven. (For, What Sin is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63725:56"/>committed againſt the moſt High God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> that is not firſt plotted in the heart? as anon ſhall be ſhewed more largely). It is a Rebel rebelling againſt the Law of our Minds, ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. It rebells againſt God and his bleſſed Spirit of Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Now to act Treaſon, and to harbour known Traytors, are alike Capital: It was the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand once of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to one of his Lords, <hi>That he would give way for one to inhabite in a Houſe that he had, who had been before found to have a Trayterous heart to his Prince;</hi> The lord replyed, <hi>That he would at his Command give way; but he ſhould no ſooner leave his Houſe, but he would burn it down with fire: For, my Ancestors,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>never built that Houſe to harbour Traytors:</hi> God giveth no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to us to harbour any treacherous Thought within us, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. Nor did he make our hearts to harbour Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in, but to be his own peculiar, his Houſe and Temple; yea, Bed-Chamber. How dare we then entertain ſuch Traytors, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cogitations are, and lay them in God's, own Bed, and ſet them upon his Throne? Can we think, that Treaſon againſt God is a leſs Crime then Treaſon againſt Man? What <hi>Sylla</hi> ſaid of <hi>Caeſar</hi> whilſt he was young, <hi>In this one Boy there be many Marii;</hi> ſo may we ſay of ſome one ſinful Thought, In that one, there are many Treaſons againſt God, therefore entertain it not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is nothing that doth more diſcover the power of Grace, and prove the ſincerity of the heart, than to make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Thoughts. A wicked man may watch over his words and actions, in reſpect of man; But the ſanctified man only is careful to obſerve the tenth Commandment, which rectifies the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heart. The difference betwixt the Regenerate and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate, in reſpect of Thoughts, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews, Prov. 12.5. <hi>The Thoughts of the Righteous are right, but the Counſels of the Wicked are deceit.</hi> The one acknowledgeth God to be the Lord of his Thoughts, as well as of his Words and Actions, and therefore is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that his Thoughts may be right; they ſhall be ordinarily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the maintainance and furthering of God's Glory, and good Cauſes; for the procuring good to their Brethren, and for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of their own Happineſs and Salvation: but the ſtudy of the wicked, and working of their minds, is, how to deceive God of his Glory, their Neighbours of their Right, and themſelves of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If we then deſire to have the teſtimony and witneſs of a good
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63725:57"/>Conſcience, then, we are upright, let us be careful to keep our thought and Cogitations within compaſs: And that,</p>
            <p>In the third place, In reſpect of ſinful Thoughts themſelves (for in that reſpect they are not to be leightly ſet by): which will appear, if we ſeriouſly conſider their Nature or their Number.</p>
            <p>They are of a vile Nature, being the fruits of the Fleſh, which being unmortified,<note place="margin">Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli. <hi>Jerom.</hi>
               </note> will aſſuredly bring God's wrath upon us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5, 6. Yea, they are the firſt-born of the Devil. Sathan dares not tempt any one to Murther, Adultery, &amp;c. or any ſuch grievous ſin, before he hath ſent forth an evil Thought, to try whether he ſhall be welcome. So that as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtyled <hi>Reuben,</hi> his Might, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Strength, in that he was his firſt-born, and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Child, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.3. So may ſinful Thoughts be termed the ſtrength of Sathan, for that his ſtrength to do miſchief lies in them, as <hi>Samſons</hi> ſtrength lay in his hair; for without their help, he could not hurt us. This their Strength is two wayes diſcovered; Firſt, In their promoting and furthering of all Sathans temptations. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In their interrupting and hindering us in every good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.</p>
            <p>Sathan ſuggeſts his Temptations into the Heart, and Luſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives by thoſe Suggeſtions of his, giving them admittance in thought; then follows delight, then conſent of will; after conſent, execution, or practiſe of the ſin; after practiſe, comes cuſtom in practiſe; and after that, follows Death and Damnation; This is that which St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every man when he it tempted, is entiſed and drawn away by his own Concupiſcence.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. in <hi>Pſal. 91.</hi> Aſtutiam ſua dendi, non poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam cogen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di habet.</note> The Devil tempts, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtrain and make us ſin againſt our wills; he hath a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſleight, but no enforcing might; our own concupiſence carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the chief ſtroak therein. Nor will Seed ever grow into a living Creature, without a Womb to foſter it; there muſt be <hi>Partus Cordis</hi> as well as <hi>Seminarium hoſtis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard,</hi> the conception of the Heart, as the temptation of Sathan. Luſt gives his ſuggeſtions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into the Mind and Thought, by delighting in them, conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, and ſhaping of them, and ſo conceives. And having thus conceived by the Devil, <hi>It bringeth forth Sin,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: The heart grows very big ſoon after the conception and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Womb; and as the Mother, in order of Nature, is full of pain till ſhe be delivered, <hi>Job</hi> 15.32. ſo is it here, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63725:57"/>And then after Conception and Birth, in bringing into Act, follows it's Perfection: <hi>For Sin when it is finiſhed, it bringeth forth Death;</hi> It goeth on without wearineſs or murmuring, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and repining in the wayes of Luſt, running on ſtill in ſinful Courſes, till the meaſure be filled up; the Thoughts taking great care how to fulfil the luſt of the Heart, till they come to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect growth, and are fit for the Slaughter.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.13</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is the Luſt of the Heart only a mother, and a nurſing-mother, in bringing forth and bringing up; but it is likewiſe a very fruitful mother, bringing forth many, and thoſe monſtrous Births.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No part of man can ſin without the Heart, the Heart can ſin without the reſt. The Hand cannot ſin, unleſs the thought of the Heart hath been conſenting; the thoughts of the Heart have many times intended a ſin which it never brought into action, yet ſinned in that intention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Body ſometimes waxeth weary in committing ſome ſinful act, but the thought of it never waxeth weary: once a day is enough for the Body, it may be tyred out with that; but a hundred times in a day, he mind can commit it without wearineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No place nor company can keep the Thoughts from ſinning: An Adulterous heart will commit Adultery in the chaſteſt Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: A Theeviſh heart will rob and ſteal in the moſt ſacred place it comes into. But Place and Company, is a reſtraint to the Body from acting thoſe ſins it hath a deſire unto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. More ſins are committed, and far greater by the Thought than by any other Member. A world of wickedneſs is committed by the Tongue, ſaith St. <hi>James;</hi> yet it comes ſhort of the Heart in ſinning. A Thief doth not rob every man in the Town, but a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous heart may wiſh, that the whole Town were his, and the next Town to that, &amp;c. An Adulterer cannot vitiate every woman, good and bad; yet he may commit Adultery both with chaſt and unchaſt in his heart; A man may ſin infinitely in his Thoughts, and never have done. And thus you have heard wherein the ſtrength of this firſt-born of Sathan lies, in promoting of Evil. Now let me ſhew you the ſtrength of it, in hindring of us in the performance of what is Good.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of a man's being drawn aſide by his own Luſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. that is; they move the powers of the Soul out of their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63725:58"/>right place, they draw them out of the right path of God's Precepts, and entiſe them out of the way; as Theevs do an honeſt Traveller, that he may rob him of his money. Thus are our Thoughts drawn away from God, when we are about his Worſhip and Service; or elſe ſo diſturbed and diſtracted by them, as that we have but little profit or comfort in the diſcharge thereof.</p>
            <p>God complains of the Hypocritical Jews, that they were a People that <hi>drew near to him with their mouths, but their hearts were far from him,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8. Their falſe and deceitful hearts were carried away with worldly and carnal thoughts, as we read, <hi>Ezek</hi> 33.31. Their hearts went after their Covetouſneſs, albeit their Bodies were preſent. Now you know what God ſaith of ſuch as ſhould go about to draw our hearts from him, <hi>If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend, which is as thine own Soul, entiſe thee ſecretly, ſaying, Let us go and ſerve other gods.</hi> —<hi>Thou ſhalt not conſent nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare him, neither ſhalt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal him, but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 13.6, 8, 9, 10. The like may be ſaid and applyed to the Point in hand Let our Thoughts and Cogitations be never ſo profitable and delightful, yet if they go about to draw our hearts from God in his Worſhip and Service, ſpare them not, but endeavour the mortification of them, even their utter ruine and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>If, in caſe the Heart be ſo over-powred by the Spirit of Grace, as that it will not be wholly called off from the performance and diſcharge of Religious Duties by wicked Thoughts; then they will endeavour to intermingle themſelves with the motions of Grace, dealing herein as the Adverſaries of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> did with <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> and the chief of the Fathers, in offering their ſervice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building of the Temple, ſaying, <hi>Let us build with you, for we ſeek your God as you do,</hi> Ezra 4.2. This they did not with any purpoſe to promote, but to hinder the Building: So, whilſt we are hearing of the Word, ſome good meditation may come into the mind, or ſome good thought and purpoſe of doing this or that good Work; but ſuch thoughts tend but to diſtract us, and deprive us of the Bleſſings of a profitable Hearer. At the time of Prayer, they will be ready to fill the head with many holy inſtruction, that at ſome other time we have read, heard, and learned: Thoughts and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63725:58"/>Purpoſes in themſelves Divine, but the Spirit that ſuggeſts them at this time, is not Divine but Diabolical; for that it hinders devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and draws away the mind from being intent upon the buſineſs in hand, and ſo deforms the work, as colour miſplaced in the face doth the beauty; for if the blewneſs that ſhould be in the Veins, be in the Lips, and the redneſs that ſhould be in the Checks, be in the Noſe, we count it a deformity: Or, as Letters miſplaced in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and not rightly compoſed, (be they never ſo fair) marr and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſenſe. So is it in this Caſe, when good Thoughts, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable, and out of their due time, interpoſe in holy actions, be they never ſo pious ſeemingly, if they be not proper and pertinent to the work in hand.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes we ſhall find our ſelves much troubled and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with idle and vagrant Thoughts whilſt we are about holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which come about as like Bees, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and with their humming noiſe keep our minds from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the work we are about:<note place="margin">Gen. 15.11.</note> Or like the Birds which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> drove away from lighting on his Sacrifice, that it might not be peck't; theſe muſt we by our beſt endeavour chaſe away: Indeed, we may ſooner drive away the Devil himſelf, then all wandring thoughts, at ſuch a time as we are Sacrificing; there is no good Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that we go about, no place that we call upon God in, but we ſhall meet with theſe impudent Diſturbers of us: <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. But this ſhould not diſhearten us from uſing the means that we may be rid of them, but ſtir up your diligence the more. Now what the means are, that muſt be uſed whereby our Thoughts may be brought in ſubjection to the Government of Chriſt; I ſhall in the next place ſhew.</p>
            <p>Firſt, See that you be renewed in the Spirit of your minds, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoughts and imaginations are conceived and framed: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the Apoſtle gives the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> Who after he had with a moſt ſerious atteſtation or admiration dehorted them from walking, as other Gentiles walked, <hi>In the vanities of their minds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.17.</note> by which he underſtood the vain and impious imaginations th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t they had of God, and of his Worſhip, the mind being the ſubject in which they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got and reſide; <hi>The Seat of Principles,</hi> ſaith the Philoſopher,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ariſt. Ethic.</hi> l. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the manſion-Houſe, or dwelling-place which Vanities hath choſen to dwell in:</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:63725:59"/>He then comes to exhort them to the leading of a new life, which that they may do, he wills them to have a ſpecial care of renuing of the beſt and divineſt faculty of the Soul of man; <hi>Be ye renewed in the ſpirit of your Mind,</hi> Epheſ. 4.23. that is, in that ſpirit which is your mind: In that, the Apoſtle directs to begin the work of repairing; that, being the firſt mover, the root and fountain of all our actions: not by way of excluſion, as if the mind only were to be renewed, for it muſt be extended to the whole man, but by way of Principality; if that be renewed, the reſt will follow; and if that Spring be not firſt cleanſed, in vain do we ſcoure the Channels.</p>
            <p>This Renuing <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expreſſeth, by the repairing of an old Houſe: as there is the ſame Houſe, the ſame Rooms, only it is new hung, or new whited; ſo there is the ſame man, the ſame mind; only the old Corruption is tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n away, and new Grace beſtowed: As in a poyſoned River, there is the Water, the running, and the poyſon; when it is healed, the water and the running remain, only the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is taken out of if. So it is in the renewing of the mind, the ſame ſubſtance, the ſame faculties of knowing, remembring, &amp;c. abide; only new qualities are effected and wrought by the power of God's Spirit. Till this be done, we cannot expect that our thoughts will be altered and changed, or the other directions that ſhall be given, any thing available for the ſubduing of them: But, this being hoped of you, we proceed;</p>
            <p>Secondly, Work thy Heart to a perfect deteſtation of all wicked and ſinfull Cogitations, that thou mayſt ſay with <hi>David, I hate all vain Thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 119.113. It is not enough for thee to diſlike them only, but that thou muſt abhorr them and deteſt them (for a cold diſlike may turn at laſt to an earneſt love); yea, ſo abhorr them, as that thou do abhorr and loath thy ſelf in regard of them: God promiſeth the Houſe of <hi>Iſreal,</hi> That <hi>He will ſave them from all their Uncleanneſs,</hi> Ezek. 36.29. But then ſaith he, <hi>You ſhall remember your own evil wayes, and your Doings which were not good; and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquities and abominations,</hi> ver. 31. intimating, That when a man begins to look upon himſelf, and comes once to ſee the pollution of his ſpirit, he cannot but loath himſelf, and grow into an indignation againſt himſelf for it. Whilſt he looks upon his ſinful Life, he appears like a rotten and dead Carkaſe, loathſome; but when he looks upon his inward
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63725:59"/>ſpirit, from whence comes thoſe evil Thoughts and ſinful Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his, he doth; as it were, anatomize and open that rotten Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſe, and then the ſavour of it is far more loathſome and odious in his Noſtrills; this muſt be done, before we can have any comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance, that God will ſave us from our Uncleanneſs, that is, pardon them in and through the merits of Chriſt. And thus, if thou hateſt thy ſinful Thoughts with a perfect hatred, ſo as to loath them, and abhorr thy ſelf in regard of them, thou wilt deal by them as <hi>Ammon</hi> did by his ſiſter <hi>Tamar;</hi> who after he had committed folly with her, and ſatisfied his Luſt upon her, hated her exceedingly, <hi>So that the hatred wherewith he hated her, was greater then the love wherewith he before loved her,</hi> ſaith the Text, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.15. Inſomuch that he thruſt her out of Doors, and commanded, that the Door ſhould be bolted after her, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, Thou muſt do what lies in thee to turn them out of thy heart, and keep them out of thy heart: which thou wilt never do, unleſs thou hateſt them exceedingly, which thou canſt not but do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if thou remembreſt effectually what hath been before ſaid of them in the Motives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Furniſh thy heart with ſtore of good matter, that thy thoughts may find imployment about that which is good: A good man hath a good treaſury in his heart, as our Saviour tells us; and an evil man hath an evil treaſury there, and out of their treaſury Both bring forth accordingly, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.35. The good man, out of his habit of heavenly-mindedneſs, will ever be thinking and ſpeaking of what is good: <hi>The mouth of the Righteous, ſpeaketh wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>), <hi>and his Tongue talketh of Judgment: The Law of God is in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 37.30, 31. But the wicked man, or man of <hi>Belial</hi> walketh with a froward mouth; and, as if his mouth were not open enough to expreſs his wickedneſs; he winketh with his Eyes (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhews), and in ſo doing, he ſpeaks deceit; he ſpeaks with his Feet, rage and anger, by ſtamping; he teacheth his Fingers, and ſo by his pointings and ſigns, ſpeaks ſcoffs and mocks; And the reaſon of all this, is, lewd things are in his heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. Out of that evil treaſury that is in him, he brings forth ſuch evil things; His heart is no other then a Stew of unclean and polluted thoughts; A very Shamble of cruel and bloody thoughts; An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change or Shop of vain thoughts; A very Forge and Mint of falſe, politique, and undermining thoughts: yea, many times a very Hell
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63725:60"/>of confuſed and black thoughts (as ſpeaks a judicious and godly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine);<note place="margin">

Therefore be ſure, that the Treaſure in thy heart be a good Treaſure: A true Treaſure, as you know, is of what is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, (we do not eſteem Stones and Pibbles, Traſh and Rubbiſh, to be a Treaſure); and there muſt be good good Store of it too, elſe it is no Treaſure. <hi>How precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O God, and how great is the Sum of them?</hi> Pſal. 139.17. that is, The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that I have of thee and of thoſe excellent and great Works of thine (which before he had mentioned), they are in my eſteem very precious; the ſpecialties are innumerable, if I ſhould count them, they are more in number than the Sand: Here was a Treaſure indeed, Great and Good. And God is not wanting to furniſh our hearts with Store of ſuch Treaſure, affording us matter for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both from his Word and Works.

And <hi>Climacus</hi> (a Greek Father) tells us of a Cook-Servant in a Colledg, a very Religious man, who was very devout in ſerving God, and often moved with Compunction to mourn for Sin: This Father asking him by what means he attained to ſuch a degree of Mortification and Holineſs, anſwered; I, in this work of the Kitchen, did never think that I ſerved men but God, who hath enjoyned me to be faithful in my place; and when I look on this fire in the Chimney, and conſider how intolerable the burning of it would be to my Fleſh, I am put in mind of the everlaſting and much more unſufferable burning of Hell-fire, due to all impenitent Sinners; and the thought of that Torment doth cauſe me thus to ſhed tears for my Sins.

            <p>Fourthly, Turn away thine Eyes from ſinful and carnal Objects, at leaſt ſuffer them not long to dwell upon them. <hi>Caſſian</hi> relates, that to preſerve the cleanneſs of the Heart, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Fathers taught, that men ought to be <hi>ſurdi, coeci, muti,</hi> deaf, blind, and dumb; that ſo, the Gates being ſhut, the ſafety of the Heart might be the ſurer kept. And <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> ſpeaking of the Practice of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>under the Law, who uſed when any dead Corps was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any of their Houſes to ſhut their Doors and Windows, he gives this to be the Moral Reaſon of the Law, We are to ſhut both our Eyes and Ears when any Sin is propoſed; for, that Senſe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Sin; that opens the Door and lets the Temptation come in. It is incredible what a deal of Pollution the Devil conveighs into our minds through our Senſes, (which ſome reſemble to the five Cinque-Ports, where all his lading is taken in,) eſpecially by the Ears and Eyes, the Doors and Windows by which the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Air of Wickedneſs is let in, to infect the Heart. By the Ear is received the Poyſon of ſcurrilous Songs, obſcene Jeſts, laſcivious Stories, which infect the mind with thoughts of Unchaſtity; or falſe Reports and Slanders, which breed thoughts of Revenge and Cruelty, and therefore Chriſt's warning ſhould in this Caſe take place, <hi>Take heed how you hear,</hi> Luke 8.18. A good Chriſtian, as he will not ſpeak filthy Language, ſo he will not hear it; as he will not ſlander with his Tongue, ſo he will not receive in his Ears a falſe Report, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.3. as he will not murther with his hands, ſo he ſtops his Ears from hearing of Blood, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.15. But a ſpecial care is to be had of the Eye; for, as God tells <hi>Iſrael, Their Eyes would cauſe them to go a Whoring,</hi> Numb. 15.39. ſo it fell out, Luſting was the Iſſue of their Looking, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. Thus <hi>David</hi> was betrayed by his Eyes, in caſting an idle Glance on <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.2. and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Miſtreſs was enſnared by caſting her Eyes upon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.7. Luſt is quick-ſighted, and many thouſand Souls have dyed of the Wound in the Eye; for the Eye is an occaſion not only of this Sin of Adultery, but of moſt others. <hi>I ſaw a fine Babyloniſh Garment</hi> (ſaid <hi>Achan</hi>), <hi>I coveted, and I took it,</hi> Joſb. 7.21. <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, becauſe all our Care is too little for the keeping of ſo quick a Member, deſire the Lord with <hi>David,</hi> that he would turn away your Eyes from beholding Vanity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37.

            <p>Fifthly, See that your Affections be rightly ordered and ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good Objects, and kept in a good Frame and holy Temper, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Set your Affections upon things above, not upon things that are upon the Earth.</hi> We muſt get not minds only, or thoughts only, but ſound affections to things heavenly; they muſt be ſet upon them, and fixed on them. As our Affections are, ſuch of neceſſity will our Thoughts be; What we love or take delight in, we cannot keep our minds from thinking on: Can a Maid forget her Ornaments, or the Bride her Attire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.32. No, they cannot, for that they love them and take delight in them, and therefore mind them. We uſually ſay to ſome that mind not their buſineſs, What think you on? ſure, you are in Love: As if Love took up all their Thoughts. So Love to God, and Love to his Word, would take off our Thoughts from the Love of the World and worldly Vanities. The Godly and Bleſſed Man, ſpoken of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. is ſaid to have his Delight in the Law of God, and delighting in it he could not but he muſt meditate therein Day and Night, <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Oh, How love I thy Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>)? <hi>It is my Meditation continually,</hi> Pſal. 119.97. His Heart was filled with the Love of God and his Word, and that ſo filled his Soul with holy Thoughts and Meditations, as that he had neither room nor leiſure for vain and ſinful Thoughts to take place. So <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.16. the Fear of God and Thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name, are joyned together; for what we do indeed fear, we
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63725:62"/>moſt think upon. Thus the thoughts that proceed from holy, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will eat up and devour our carnal thoughts and cares, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intimates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. Wherefore keep ſpiritual Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hot and lively in thy Soul, ſuffer them not to cool, and thou ſhalt ſoon be rid of many vain and ſinful thoughts that now annoy thee. Flies light not upon what is hot, but upon that Veſſel that hath cold Liquor in it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Begin the day with holy Thoughts and Meditations. It was God's Command, that <hi>the firſt that opened the Matrix ſhould be his,</hi> Exod. 34.19. So the firſt-born of thy thoughts daily are God's, not thine but by Sacriledg: <hi>When I awake</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I am ſtill with thee,</hi> Pſal. 139.18. that is, I no ſooner open mine eyes but my thoughts are of thee, and I am with thee in meditating of thy wonderful Goodneſs, in preſerving and keeping of me, and of thy great Works and Wiſdom. So at the inſtant of you awaking, let your hearts be lifted up to God in a thankful acknowledgment of his Goodneſs to you the Night paſt, in giving you comfortable Reſt; for he it is that <hi>giveth his beloved Sleep,</hi> Pſal. 127.2. In preſerving of you from the dangers of the Night-paſt; for it is he that <hi>hath kept thee,</hi> Prov. 6.22. And he it is that <hi>reneweth his Mercies to thee every Morning</hi> Lament. 3.22, 23. This is to awake with God, and to ſpeak firſt with him; till then no other thought nor buſineſs is to be admitted. At your firſt awaking, you ſhall find multitude of Thoughts attending on you to ſpeak with you,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi>'s. Vanity of Thoughts.</note> like Clients (ſaith one ſpeaking of this Subject) at a great Lawyers Door in the Term time. Now put Caſe ſome great Lord ſhould be there amongſt the reſt; Would he take it well if every inferiour Perſon ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Lawyer's Cloſet before him, and he made to waite without doors till every Country Client were diſpatched? Judge then in this Caſe whether God will take it well at thy hands, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry baſe and worldly thought ſhall be admitted into thy mind ſo ſoon as thou awakeſt, and he laſt and leaſt thought of who ought firſt to be heard and ſerved. It is good to conſecrate a man's firſt awaking unto God; <hi>In the Morning</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I will direct my Prayer unto thee, and will look up,</hi> Pſal. 5.3. In ſo doing, he knew his Prayer and Meditations ſhould not be loſt; he would look after it (as Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do after their Petitions which they prefer unto their Prince), not doubting but to have a gracious Anſwer. Certainly, you ſhall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63725:62"/>find, that religious Thoughts let into the heart in the Morning at our firſt awaking, will keep it in better tune all the day after; when worldly Thoughts are admitted, they will but trouble us and diſtract us the more the whole day following; or they ſtand about us but as Cheſſe-men, to take up the Heart for the Uſe of the World, Fleſh, and Devil, and to draw away the Heart from the Service of our Maker. The Wicked give their firſt Thoughts to thoſe: let us devote our firſt Meditations to God's Glory, ſo if we be ready to praiſe him (and till that be done we are unready) he will be ready to bleſs us.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Have a vigilant and watchful eye over thy Thoughts the whole day after; for albeit thou ſeaſon thy Soul with private and holy Meditations in the Morning, yet a great care muſt be had the whole day following to keep them from Infection, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our corrupt Nature we are apt ſo receive. He that gives way to the ſuggeſtion of an evil Thought, can hardly ſtop the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a depraved Will, or ſtay the working of an evill hand. It is Wiſdom's Advice, above all keepings ſo keep the Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.24. Set a ſtrong Watch about that; which if thou doſt, thou ſhalt be ſure to take in thy Watch many wandring and roving Thoughts; theſe muſt be taken up as Vagrants, and corrected and ſent away with a Paſs to the place where they were born: Others are ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and unruly Thoughts, Thoughts of Atheiſm, Blaſphemy, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, diſhonourable to God; or Thoughts of Malice, Revenge, Pride, Deceipt, prejudicial to thy Neighbour: Theſe are like your ſturdy Rogues that come unto your Doors, and give ill Language, uſe threatning words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe lay hands upon, and carry them to the next Juſtice, even to the Lord chief Juſtice of the whole World and complain of them to him, that they may be brought into Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Shew not the leaſt favour to any of them; and do it betimes, at the very firſt appearance of them. Theſe are thoſe Brats which muſt be daſhed againſt the Scones whileſt they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137.</note> if we would be freed from <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity of Sin: Other Thoughts thou ſhalt apprehend in thy Watch which are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but unſeaſonable: and in performance of Family Duties or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Devotions (of which ſomething was ſaid before), be aſſured that ſome Thought or other (it may be of thy particular Calling) will be jogging thee on the Elbow, or pulling thee by the Sleeve,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63725:63"/>and will thee to make haſte, thy Mother and thy Brethren are without to ſpeak with thee; let theſe ſtay a while, put them by till another time. Say as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to his Servants, <hi>Abide you here at the bottom of the hill with the Aſſe, whilſt I and the Lad go to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip yonder, and I will come again to you,</hi> Gen. 22.5. Other thoughts you ſhall meet withall, that can give you a good, account whence they come, and what they go about, being good ſeaſonable, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; theſe relieve and ſuccour according to Statute, as God hath commanded.</p>
            <p>And as this Watch much be daily kept, ſo eſpecially upon the Lord's Day above all other Dayes; for then naughty thoughts (like vagrant Rogues) are prone to do us moſt miſchief. If we can but order our thoughts well this day, we ſhall order them the better the whole week after; but if in caſe you let your thoughts looſe upon the Sabbath (as ſome careleſs Maſters do their Servants) to go where they will, and do what they will, you ſhall not have them at ſo good command the ſix dayes following. It is a day that God hath ſet apart for this end, that we may be better enabled to keep our thoughts in order when we come to follow the works of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Calling; and without we do it, we cannot expect a bleſſing on our Labour, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13, 14.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Avoid Solitarineſs and Idleneſs, I joyn them, becauſe they are ſeldom ſeparated, and the Devil makes a like uſe of both, taking occaſion from both to fill the mind with dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable thoughts. When <hi>Eve</hi> was ſtragling from her Husband (for ſo it is generally held) curiouſly viewing the pleaſant Plants of the Garden, then the Devil took an occaſion to ſuggeſt into her mind baſe thoughts of God:<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1, 2.</note> When <hi>Dinah, Jacob</hi>'s Daughter, was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring alone idly from her Father's Tent, to ſee the faſhions of the Country,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.1, 2.

            <p>Yet it cannot be denied, that thoſe ſinful thoughts which diſtract us in holy Duties, are (if not altogether yet) for the moſt part from within our ſelves, ariſing from man's corrupt heart, and occaſioned by a great neglect in the performance of our Duties: As in want of preparation, before we enter upon the Duty, we bring with in unſanctified and unprepared thoughts to the hearing and reading of the Word, to Prayer, and the like; we ſet not our ſelves as in God's preſence, not conſidering how great a God and holy a God we have to deal withall; we receive the Word, as the Word of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63725:65"/>Man; we pray as to man (it may be, not ſo reverently, but) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and hypocritically, for vain-glory and by-reſpects. That is a great wane of attention ſo what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, Are not theſe thy wanderings of thy Spirit grievous unto thee, and burthenſome; doſt thou not go under them, as under a heavy load, which thou wouldſt give a world, were it in thy power, to be rid of?</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Doſt thou not in obedience to God's Will, ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the combate betwixt the Fleſh and Spirit, and fighteſt lawfully; and albeit thou receiveſt many a foil, yet thou are careful preſently to ralley thy ſcattered forces again and again, and wilt not give over thy attendance upon God's Ordinances, but putteſt on firmer Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to be more watchful?</p>

               </label> And why not? who can keep Sathan from tempting (God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting) to the vileſt ſins that ever was committed? And in that they are ſo horrid, the more likely are they to be Sathans, and that he did put them into you, and ſo not your own. Indeed it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard and difficult to put an exact difference betwixt Sathans ſuggeſtions, and thoſe that ariſe from our own corrupt Nature, and ſomewhat curious to enquire. That there is a difference, I know,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bern.</hi> Cant. Ser. <hi>32.</hi> Capel on Tempt.</note> ſaith one, but where the indiviſible point of that difference doth ſtand, I know not: Indeed we ſhall find, that ordinarily they are ſo mixed, that the ſame ſinful thoughts are aſcribed both to Sathan and to Man. It is ſaid (as was noted before), <hi>That Sathan moved</hi> David <hi>to number the People,</hi> 1 Chron. 21.1. And yet afterwards <hi>David</hi> confeſſed it to be his ſin, that he numbred them, ver. 8. So <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3. <hi>Peter</hi> tells <hi>Ananias, That Sathan had filled his heart to lye to the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and yet, ver. 4. he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt lyed not to Man, but to God.</hi> Sathan begets, but it is the Heart that conceiveth and brings forth: Notwithſtanding the ſuggeſtions of Satan may at ſome times be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of our own Hearts, by theſe apparant Differences.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For matter; Sathan's ſuggeſtions are oftentimes ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly wicked, that even Nature it ſelf (though corrupted) doth abhorr them, when they are firſt ſuggeſted to the mind. No Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth ariſe from the Fleſh, but the Devil interpoſeth himſelf, and ſpeaks his good word for them. And though commonly the Fleſh, to re-gratifie the Devil, ſets forward his Temptation; yet it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63725:67"/>may ſometimes ſo fall out, that the Devil tempts alone, and that ſo groſly (ſaith a godly Divine), that the very Fleſh is a ſhamed of them; thoſe that come from the Fleſh, are more ſutable to Nature, and more delightful and pleaſing to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the manner of their injection; Sathans ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſudden, like a flaſh of Lightening, and with ſuch unavoydable violence, as that they cannot by any wit or ſtrength of the party be prevented, But thoſe that come from our ſinful and corrupt Nature, are more deliberate; it doth rather lead and entiſe, than enforce unto ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. His temptations are ſometimes ſo ſubtil and ſtrange, that, before the inſtant that they are ſuggeſted, we never thought of ſuch a thing; nor was it poſſible that they ſhould be the thoughts of a ſimple ignorant man, but the apparant ſuggeſtions of the old Serpent. But the Fleſh takes occaſion of things preſent, and ſubject to the ſenſes, to intiſe us unto evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the Effect: A man's thoughts being natural, work no extraordinary perturbation of mind; But Satan's ſuggeſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemous, ſtrikes the heart with horror: the Underſtanding is aſtoniſhed, the Heart quaketh, &amp;c. unleſs by long cuſtom, and continual ſinning,<note place="margin">Dearnad.</note> the heart is become Diabolical. And theſe are the chief differences that Divines give between thoſe ſinful thoughts that are the immediate ſuggeſtions of Satan, and thoſe that ariſe from our own hearts: Otherwiſe they are ſo like the one to the other, that they can hardly be diſcerned. But if in caſe ſuch hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid thoughts ariſing in your hearts, be ſuch, as that not ſo much as the Affections do incline unto them; but on the contrary, thou doſt wholly abhor them in the very firſt ariſing thereof; you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them to be rather the ſuggeſtions of Sathan, then from your own concupiſcence. And that they ſhall be put on his Score, and not on yours; nor ſhall they ever be imputed unto us, for that they leave no guilt upon us.</p>
            <p>And put caſe, that theſe horrid and blaſphemous Thoughts are ours, either becauſe they ariſe from our own ſinful concupiſcence, or for that we give too much way unto them when they do ariſe: yet there is no cauſe for thee to infer from thence, that thou art not therefore the Child of God, or that God loves thee not, in that he thus ſuffers thee to be tempted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For that there are no kind of Temptations more commonly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63725:67"/>incident to God's Children, eſpecially being afflicted in mind, than theſe. So ordinarily doth Sathan ſight with this Weapon, that he durſt aſſault the Son of God with it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.9. and yet he was the unſpotted Lamb of God, in whom was no manner of Sin, no, not ſo much as the leaſt degree of carnal Concupiſcence; Can we wonder then, if any of the members of his Body-myſtical be thus aſſaulted? With this conſideration St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtayes the hearts of the godly <hi>Corinthtans,</hi> leſt they ſhould be too much dejected under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's Temptations; <hi>There hath no Temptation taken you, but ſuch as are common to man,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. that is, to a Chriſtian man whilſt he is in the ſtate of mortality: <hi>It ſo appertains to him</hi> (ſaith a learned Doctor) <hi>as the Soul it ſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dr.</hi> Donne. <hi>p.</hi> 789.</note> 
               <hi>and as Reaſon appertains to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man.</hi> He is not a man, that is without a reaſonable Soul; he is not a Chriſtian, that is without Temptation. It appertains unto man, ſo, as that it is convenient; more then ſo, as that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; more then that, that it is neceſſary; more then all that, that it is eſſential to a Chriſtian. Indeed, every Chriſtian is not aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch horrid and blaſphemous Thoughts, as ſome others are; but none are wholly freed from all Satanical Temptations; nor can any man aſſure himſelf that he ſhall be exempted from Temptations of that Nature, ſeeing they appertain to man; to one as well as to another.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Albeit God in his wiſdom may permit Sathan to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet thee with theſe helliſh Temptations; yet he keeps the hook in his Noſtrils, and wills nothing to his Children, but what he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules to their good; ſometimes Pride is hereby prevented: Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of Revelations, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are awaked thereby out of our deep ſleep of Sin, and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to renue our Repentance for ſome Sin, that as yet we have not been throughly humbled for. Sometimes God ſuffers it for the tryal and exerciſe of our Graces, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.3. And ſometimes that his Grace may appear in our weakneſs, ſupporting and upholding of us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. But whatever the Reaſons are, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to turn all to the good of his; And therein we may comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably reſt aſſured, that albeit it be not God's good pleaſure wholly to free us from them; yet they ſhall tend to our profit, and that he will give a good iſſue out of them in the end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:63725:68"/>
            <p>Thirdly, The Comfort of a Chriſtian lyes in his reſiſting of Temptation: It is not a Sin ſimply to be tempted, if we do not yield to the Temptation, but reſiſt it with all our Power, we are ſafe enough. The chaſteſt Matron in the World may be aſſaulted, (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was by a great Lady), yet ſhe is never a whit the worſe for that, if ſhe aſſent not, but the better to be thought of: Ill Counſel is the fault of the Giver, not of the Receiver. We read in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 22.26. that if a Virgin were raviſhed in the field, and that ſhe cryed out for help when ſhe was aſſailed, and that none came in to her reſcue, in ſuch a Caſe it ſhould not be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as her Sin; for, as when a man riſeth up againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſlayeth him, even ſo is this matter. So, if the Devil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Rape upon thy Soul, and thou cryeſt out ſo God, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy blaſphemous Suggeſtions before him, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Letter of railing <hi>Rabſhekah,</hi> Iſa. 37.14. If thou humbly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely proteſteſt thine own Innocency in his ſight, thou art a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man, and in the Caſe of God's bleſſed Children. The greater thy Temptations are, the more noble ſhall thy reſiaſtnce be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more exemplary thy Life and Vertues, the greater in the end ſhall be thy Crown and Glory.</p>

Whileſt Satan and you were Friends, he was well content that you ſhould go on in your formal Profeſſion without diſturbance; meddle not with Repentance, and

            <p>We ſhall do well to diſtinguiſh of Dreams: Some are Natural, others Supernatural. The Natural ariſe from Complexion or from Affection: From Complexion or Conſtitution, as from Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Blood, Flegm, and Melancholy: The Sanguine hath merry Dreams; the Melancholy, ſorrowful; the Chollerick, Dreams of ſire; the Flegmatick, of Floods and Rain, and ſuch watery, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
